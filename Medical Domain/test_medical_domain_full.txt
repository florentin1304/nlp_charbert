PROCEDURE: , Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation.,INDICATION: , Sacroiliac joint pain.,INFORMED CONSENT: , The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE: , Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.,The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.  After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds.,All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,ADDITIONAL DETAILS:  ,None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISCUSSION: , Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute left subdural hematoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute left subdural hematoma.,PROCEDURE:,  Left frontal temporal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This is a 76-year-old man who has a history of acute leukemia.  He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency.  He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury.  His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy.  The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition.  He was fixed in a three-point headrest.  His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol.  We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region.  The scalp was reflected.  A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created.  After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain.  The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline.  After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline.  We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates.  The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment.  Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this.  I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Severe menometrorrhagia unresponsive to medical therapy.,2.  Anemia.,3.  Symptomatic fibroid uterus.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Severe menometrorrhagia unresponsive to medical therapy.,2.  Anemia.,3.  Symptomatic fibroid uterus.,PROCEDURE: , Total abdominal hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 150 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDING:  ,Large fibroid uterus.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for an abdominal procedure.  A scalpel was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision, which was carried down sharply through the subcutaneous tissue to the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the midline and incision was carried laterally bilaterally with curved Mayo scissors.  The fascia was then bluntly and sharply dissected free from the underlying rectus abdominis muscles.  The rectus abdominis muscles were then bluntly dissected in the midline and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The peritoneum was then bluntly entered and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The O'Connor-O'Sullivan instrument was then placed without difficulty.  The uterus was grasped with a thyroid clamp and the entire pelvis was then visualized without difficulty.  The GIA stapling instrument was then used to separate the infundibulopelvic ligament in a ligated fashion from the body of the uterus.  This was performed on the left infundibulopelvic ligament and the right infundibulopelvic ligament without difficulty.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  The bladder flap was then developed free from the uterus without difficulty.  Careful dissection of the uterus from the pedicle with the uterine arteries and cardinal ligaments was then performed using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion on the left and right side.  This was done without difficulty.  The uterine fundus was then separated from the uterine cervix without difficulty.  This specimen was sent to pathology for identification.  The cervix was then developed with careful dissection.  Jorgenson scissors were then used to remove the cervix from the vaginal cuff.  This was sent to pathology for identification.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  A #1 chromic suture ligature was then used in running fashion at the angles and along the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  Figure-of-eight sutures were then used in an interrupted fashion to close the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  The entire pelvis was washed.  Hemostasis was noted.  The peritoneum was then closed using 2-0 chromic suture ligature in running pursestring fashion.  The rectus abdominis muscles were approximated using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion.  The fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in interlocking running fashion.  Foundation sutures were then placed in an interrupted fashion for further closing the fascia.  The skin was closed with staple gun.  Sponge and needle counts were noted to be correct x2 at the end of the procedure.  Instrument count was noted to be correct x2 at the end of the procedure.  Hemostasis was noted at each level of closure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and went to recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Varicose veins.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Varicose veins.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Ligation and stripping of left greater saphenous vein to the level of the knee.,2.  Stripping of multiple left lower extremity varicose veins.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 mL.,SPECIMENS: , Multiple veins.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  This is a 30-year-old Caucasian male who presented for elective evaluation from Dr. X's office for evaluation of intractable pain from the left lower extremity.  The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg was then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg was then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix was achieved, an Ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit extubated in stable condition.  He will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Penile cellulitis status post circumcision.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 16-month-old boy, who had a circumcision performed approximately 4 days before he developed penile swelling and fever and discharge.  The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin.  He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago.  The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103.  He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care.  Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant.  He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother.  I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis.  The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient has no known allergies.  He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery.  Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions.  No other hospitalizations.  He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned.  He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with both parents and no siblings.  There are smokers at home.,MEDICATIONS: , Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment.  Also Bactrim.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 14.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.,HEAD AND NECK:  Grossly normal.  His neck and chest are without masses.,NARES:  He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft without masses or tenderness.,GU:  He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema.  There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection.  He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans.  The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time.  The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness.  Both testes were descended without hydroceles.,EXTREMITIES:  He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,BACK:  Normal.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis.  This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities.  I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad.  I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day.  I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely.  Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.  He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist  and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising.
REASON FOR VISIT:,  Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Briefly, a 16-year-old right-handed boy who is in eleventh grade, who presents with some blurred vision and visual acuity difficulties, was found to have a suprasellar tumor.  He was brought to the operating room on 01/04/07, underwent a transsphenoidal resection of tumor.  Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.  There is some residual disease; however, the visual apparatus was decompressed.  According to him, he is doing well, back at school without any difficulties.  He has some occasional headaches and tinnitus, but his vision is much improved.,MEDICATIONS: , Synthroid 100 mcg per day.,FINDINGS: , On exam, he is awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  EOMs are full.  His visual acuity is 20/25 in the right (improved from 20/200) and the left is 20/200 improved from 20/400.  He has a bitemporal hemianopsia, which is significantly improved and wider.  His motor is 5 out of 5.  There are no focal motor or sensory deficits.  The abdominal incision is well healed.  There is no evidence of erythema or collection.  The lumbar drain was also well healed.,The postoperative MRI demonstrates small residual disease.,Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.,ASSESSMENT: , Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma with residual disease.,PLANS: , I have recommended that he call.  I discussed the options with our radiation oncologist, Dr. X. They will schedule the appointment to see him.  In addition, he probably will need an MRI prior to any treatment, to follow the residual disease.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hammertoe deformity, left fifth digit.,2.  Ulceration of the left fifth digit plantolaterally.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Hammertoe deformity, left fifth toe.,2.  Ulceration of the left fifth digit plantolaterally.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroplasty of the left fifth digit proximal interphalangeal joint laterally.,2.  Excision of plantar ulceration of the left fifth digit 3 cm x 1 cm in size.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient is a 38-year-old female with longstanding complaint of painful hammertoe deformity of her left fifth toe.  The patient had developed ulceration plantarly after being scheduled for removal of a plantar mass in the same area.  The patient elects for surgical removal of this ulceration and correction of her hammertoe deformity at this time.,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted to the OR where the patient was placed on the Operating Room table in the supine position.  After adequate amount of IV sedation was administered by Anesthesia Department, the patient was given a digital block to the left fifth toe using 0.5% Marcaine plain with 1% lidocaine plain in 1:1 mixture totaling 6 cc.  Following this, the patient was draped and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  An ankle tourniquet was placed on the left ankle and the left foot was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 230 mmHg and then was brought back down to the level of the table.  The stockinette was then cut and reflected and held in place using towel clamp.,The skin was then cleansed using the wet and dry Ray-Tec sponge and then the plantar lesion was outlined.  The lesion measured 1 cm in diameter at the level of the skin and a 3 cm elliptical incision line was drawn on the surface of the skin in the plantolateral aspect of the left fifth digit.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, skin incision was made.  Following this, the incision was then deepened using a fresh #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the skin was reflected distally and proximally to the lesion.  The lesion appeared well encapsulated with fibrous tissue and through careful dissection using combination of sharp and drill instrumentation the ulceration was removed in its entirety.  The next further exploration was performed to ensure that no residual elements of the fibrous capsular tissue remained within.  The lesion extended from the level of the skin down to the periosteal tissue of the middle and distal phalanx, however, did not show any evidence of extending beyond the level of a periosteum.  Remaining tissues were inspected and appeared healthy.  The lesion was placed in the specimen container and sent to pathology for microanalysis as well as growth.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left fifth digit and using further dissection with a #15 blade, the periosteum was reflected off the lateral aspect of the proximal ________ median phalanx.  The capsule was also reflected to expose the prominent lateral osseous portion of this joint.  Using a sagittal saw and #139 blade, the lateral osseous prominence was resected.  This was removed in entirety.  Then using power-oscillating rasp, the sharp edges were smoothed and recontoured to the desirable anatomic condition.  Then the incision and wound was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline with gentamycin.  Following this, the bone was inspected and appeared to be healthy with no evidence of involvement from the removed aforementioned lesion.,Following this, using #4-0 nylon in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures, the lesion wound was closed and skin was approximated well without tension to the surface skin.  Following this, the incision site was dressed using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Coban in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was then deflated and hyperemia was noted to return to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then escorted from the operative table into the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was brought to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  In the recovery, the patient was given a surgical shoe as well as given instructions for postoperative care to include rest ice and elevation as well as the patient was given prescription for Naprosyn 250 mg to be taken three times daily as well as Vicodin ES to be taken q.6h. as needed.,The patient will follow-up on Friday with Dr. X in office for further evaluation.  The patient was also given instructions as to signs of infection and to monitor her operative site.  The patient was instructed to keep daily dressings intact, clean, dry, and to not remove them.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low Back Syndrome - Low Back Pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Same.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Bilateral facet Arthrogram at L34, L45, L5S1.,2.  Bilateral facet injections at L34, L45, L5S1.,3.  Interpretation of radiograph.,ANESTHESIA:  ,IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,INDICATION: , Pain in the lumbar spine secondary to facet arthrosis that was demonstrated by physical examination and verified with x-ray studies and imaging scans.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the OR, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  Prior to sedation vitals signs were obtained and were continuously monitored throughout the procedure for amount of pain or changes in pain, EKG, respiration and heart rate and at intervals of three minutes for blood pressure.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral regions were prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine prep and four sterile towels.,The facets in the lumbar regions were visualized with Fluoroscopy using an anterior posterior view.  A skin wheal was placed with 1% Lidocaine at the L34 facet region on the left.  Under fluoroscopic guidance a 22 gauge spinal needle was then placed into the L34 facet on the left side.  This was performed using the oblique view under fluoroscopy to the enable the view of the "Scotty Dog," After obtaining the "Scotty Dog" view the joints were easily seen.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed to verity that there was no venous, arterial or cerebral spinal fluid flow.  After negative aspiration was verified, 1/8th of a cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  Negative aspiration was again performed and 1/2 cc of solution (Solution consisting of 9 cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1 cc of Triamcinolone) was then injected into the joint.  The needle was then withdrawn out of the joint and 1.5 cc of this same solution was injected around the joint.  The 22-gauge needle was then removed.  Pressure was place over the puncture site for approximately one minute.  This exact same procedure was then repeated along the left-sided facets at L45, and L5S1.  This exact same procedure was then repeated on the right side.  At each level, vigilance was carried out during the aspiration of the needle to verify negative flow of blood or cerebral spinal fluid.,The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of the radiograph revealed placement of the 22-gauge spinal needles into the left-sided and right-sided facet joints at, L34, L45, and L5S1.  Visualizing the "Scotty Dog" technique under fluoroscopy facilitated this.  Dye spread into each joint space is visualized.  No venous or arterial run-off is noted.  No epidural run-off is noted.  The joints were noted to have chronic inflammatory changes noted characteristic of facet arthrosis.
TITLE OF PROCEDURE:  ,Coronary artery bypass grafting times three utilizing the left internal mammary artery, left anterior descending and reversed autogenous saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery and obtuse marginal coronary artery, total cardiopulmonary bypass, cold blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade and retrograde, for myocardial protection.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring devices were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The right greater saphenous vein was harvested and prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 Surgilon and flushed with heparinized blood.  Hemostasis was achieved in the legs and closed with running 2-0 Dexon in the subcutaneous tissue and running 3-0 Dexon subcuticular in the skin.  Median sternotomy incision was made and the left mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff of the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The pericardium was opened.  The pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula and bypass was instituted.  A retrograde cardioplegic cannula was placed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 Prolene suture in the right atrial wall into the coronary sinus and tied to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegic needle sump combination was placed in the ascending aorta and tied in place with 4-0 Prolene.  The ascending aorta was crossclamped.  Cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given to the ascending aorta followed by sumping through the ascending aorta followed by cold retrograde potassium cardioplegia.  The obtuse marginal coronary artery was identified and opened and end-to-side anastomosis was performed to the reversed autogenous saphenous vein with running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given and the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  Cold antegrade and retrograde potassium cardioplegia were given.  The mammary artery was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  The anterior descending was identified and opened.  End-to-side anastomosis was performed through the left internal mammary artery with running 8-0 Prolene suture.  The mammary pedicle was sutured to the heart with interrupted 5-0 Prolene suture.  A warm antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given.  The aortic crossclamp was removed.  The partial occlusion clamp was placed.  Aortotomies were made.  The veins were cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture.  A partial occlusion clamp was removed.  All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  Ventricular and atrial pacing wires were placed.  The patient was fully warmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient was decannulated in the routine fashion and Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A single mediastinal and left pleural chest tube were placed.  The sternum was closed with interrupted wire, linea alba with running 0 Prolene, the sternal fascia was closed with running 0 Prolene, the subcutaneous tissue with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 3-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,PROCEDURE,1.  Radical retropubic prostatectomy, robotic assisted.,2.  Bladder suspension.,ANESTHESIA:,  General by intubation.,The patient understands his diagnosis, grade, stage and prognosis.  He understands this procedure, options to it and potential benefits from it.  He strongly wishes to proceed.  He accepts all treatment-associated risks to include but not be limited to bleeding requiring transfusion; infection; sepsis; heart attack; stroke; bladder neck contractures; need to convert to an open procedure; urinary fistulae; impotence; incontinence; injury to bowel/rectum/bladder/ureters, etc.; small-bowel obstruction; abdominal hernia; osteitis pubis/chronic pelvic pain, etc.,DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, given a successful general anesthetic, placed in the lithotomy position, prepped with Betadine solutions and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array.  A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique.  The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision.  My assistant was on the right.  The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.,I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis.  This nicely exposed the space of Retzius.  I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.,The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally.  The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally.  Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex.  The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected.  A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex.,I then approached the bladder neck.  The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound.  I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas.  The ampullae were mobilized and transected.  These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized.  Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie.,I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply.  Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles.  I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.,The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water.  Hemostasis was found to be complete.  I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis.  This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures.  Two of these were tied together in the midline.  They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied.  A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation.  The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley., ,I then carried out a bladder suspension.  This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control.  This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures.  One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis.  This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.,The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision.  A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk.  The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl.  The skin incisions were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Aplastic anemia.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a very pleasant 72-year-old woman, who I have been following for her pancytopenia.  After several bone marrow biopsies, she was diagnosed with aplastic anemia.  She started cyclosporine and prednisone on 03/30/10.  She was admitted to the hospital from 07/11/10 to 07/14/10 with acute kidney injury.  Her cyclosporine level was 555.  It was thought that her acute kidney injury was due to cyclosporine toxicity and therefore that was held.,Overall, she tells me that now she feels quite well since leaving the hospital.  She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells while in the hospital.  Repeat CBC from 07/26/10 showed white blood cell count of 3.4 with a hemoglobin of 10.7 and platelet count of 49,000.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Folic acid, Aciphex, MiraLax, trazodone, prednisone for 5 days every 4 weeks, Bactrim double strength 1 tablet b.i.d. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.,ALLERGIES:  ,No known drug allergies.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , As per the HPI, otherwise negative.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Hypertension.,2.  GERD.,3.  Osteoarthritis.,4.  Status post tonsillectomy.,5.  Status post hysterectomy.,6.  Status post bilateral cataract surgery.,7.  Esophageal stricture status post dilatation approximately four times.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She has no tobacco use.  She has rare alcohol use.  She has three children and is a widow.  Her husband died after they were married only eight years.  She is retired.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Her sister had breast cancer.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,VIT:
DELIVERY NOTE: , The patient came in around 0330 hours in the morning on this date 12/30/08 in early labor and from a closed cervix very posterior yesterday; she was 3 cm dilated.  Membranes ruptured this morning by me with some meconium.  An IUPC was placed.  Some Pitocin was started because the contractions were very weak.  She progressed in labor throughout the day.  Finally getting the complete at around 1530 hours and began pushing.  Pushed for about an hour and a half when she was starting to crown.  The Foley was already removed at some point during the pushing.  The epidural was turned down by the anesthesiologist because she was totally numb.  She pushed well and brought the head drown crowning, at which time I arrived and setting her up delivery with prepping and draping.  She pushed well delivering the head and DeLee suctioning was carried out on the perineum because of the meconium even though good amount of amnioinfusion throughout the day was completed.  With delivery of the head, I could see the perineum tear and after delivery of the baby and doubly clamping of the cord having baby off to RT in attendance.  Exam revealed a good second-degree tear ascended a little bit up higher in the vagina and a little off to the right side but rectum sphincter were intact, although I cannot see good fascia around the sphincter anteriorly.  The placenta separated with some bleeding seen and was assisted expressed and completely intact.  Uterus firmed up well with IV pit.  Repair of the tear with 2-0 Vicryl stitches and a 3-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular like area just above the rectum and the perineum was performed using a little local anesthesia to top up with the epidural.  Once this was complete, mom and baby doing well.  Baby was a female infant.  Apgars 8 and 9.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant mass of the left neck.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Malignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURES,1.  Left neck mass biopsy.,2.  Selective surgical neck dissection, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room.  Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.,Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap.  Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.,Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass.  The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck.  A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section.  At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen.  Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements.  This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface.  There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated.  At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.,With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck.  This worked out quite nicely.  The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it.  We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A.  When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise.  Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged.  At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.,The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination.  Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen.  Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate.  The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap.  The flap was replaced in its position.  A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated.  It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it.  A pressure dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Idiopathic toe walker.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Idiopathic toe walker.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral open Achilles lengthening with placement of short leg walking cast.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  A total of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic was used.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,No intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,On the left side was 30 minutes, on the right was 21 minutes.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year.  The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally.  He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk.  Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The patient was then subsequently placed prone with all bony prominences padded.  Two bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  Both extremities were then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  We turned our attention first towards the left side.  A planned incision of 1 cm medial to the Achilles tendon was marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous fat down to the tendon sheath.  Achilles tendon was identified and Z-lengthening was done with the medial distal half cut.  Once Z-lengthening was completed proximally, the length of the Achilles tendon was then checked.  This was trimmed to obtain an end-on-end repair with 0 Ethibond suture.  This was also oversewn.  Wound was then irrigated.  Achilles tendon sheath was reapproximated using 2-0 Vicryl as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Once the wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, the area was injected with 0.5% Marcaine.  It was then dressed with 4 x 4 and Webril.  Tourniquet was released at 30 minutes.  The same procedure was repeated on the right side with tourniquet time of 21 minutes.  While the patient was still prone, two short-leg walking casts were then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently flipped supine on to hospital gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:  ,The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  He may weightbear as tolerated in his cast, which he will have for about 4 to 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in approximately 10 days for recheck as well as prescription for intended AFOs, which he will need up to 6 months.  The patient may or may not need physical therapy while his Achilles lengthenings are healing.  The patient is not to participate in any PE for at least 6 months.  The patient is given Tylenol No. 3 for pain.
IDENTIFICATION: , The patient is a 15-year-old female.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Right ankle pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient was running and twisted her right ankle.

Her primary care physician is Dr. Brown.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Otherwise negative except as stated above.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  None.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , None.,MEDICATIONS:,  None.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Mother appears loving and caring.  There is no evidence of abuse.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , General:  The patient is alert and oriented x4 in mild distress without diaphoresis.  She is nonlethargic and nontoxic.  Vitals:  Within normal limits.  The right ankle shows no significant swelling.  There is no ecchymosis.  There is no significant tenderness to palpation.  The ankle has good range of motion.  The foot is nontender.  Vascular:  +2/2 dorsalis pedis pulse.  All compartments are soft.  Capillary refill less than 2 seconds.,DIAGNOSTIC TEST:,  The patient had an x-ray of the right ankle, which interpreted by myself shows no acute fracture or dislocation.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: , Due to the fact this patient has no evidence of an ankle fracture, she can be safely discharged to home.  She is able to walk on it without significant pain, thus I recommend rest for 1 week and follow up with the doctor if she has persistent pain.  She may need to see a specialist, but at this time this is a very mild ankle injury.  There is no significant physical finding, and I foresee no complications.  I will give her 1 week off of PE.,MORBIDITY/MORTALITY:,  I expect no acute complications.  A full medical screening exam was done and no emergency medical condition exists upon discharge.,COMPLEXITY:,  Moderate.  The differential includes fracture, contusion, abrasion, laceration, and sprain.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right ankle sprain.,PLAN:,  Discharge the patient home and have her follow up with her doctor in 1 week if symptoms persist.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Intrauterine pregnancy at term with previous cesarean section.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSES,1.  Desires permanent sterilization.,2.  Macrosomia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Desires permanent sterilization.,2.  Macrosomia.,3.  Status post repeat low transverse cesarean and bilateral tubal ligation.,PROCEDURES,1.  Repeat low transverse cesarean section.,2.  Bilateral tubal ligation (BTL).,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,FINDINGS:,  A viable female infant weighing 7 pounds 10 ounces, assigned Apgars of 9 and 9.  There was normal pelvic anatomy, normal tubes.  The placenta was normal in appearance with a three-vessel cord.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  Patient was brought to the operating room with an IV running and a Foley catheter in place, satisfactory spinal anesthesia was administered following which a wedge was placed under the right hip.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made and carried sharply down to the level of fascia.  The fascia was incised transversely.  The fascia was dissected away from the underlying rectus muscles.  With sharp and blunt dissection, rectus muscles were divided in midline.  The perineum was entered bluntly.  The incision was carried vertically with scissors.  Transverse incision was made across the bladder peritoneum.  The bladder was dissected away from the underlying lower uterine segment.  Bladder retractor was placed to protect the bladder.  The lower uterine segment was entered sharply with a scalpel.  Incision was carried transversely with bandage scissors.  Clear amniotic fluids were encountered.  The infant was out of the pelvis and was in oblique vertex presentation.  The head was brought down into the incision and delivered easily as were the shoulders and body.  The mouth and oropharynx were suctioned vigorously.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The infant was passed off to the waiting pediatrician in satisfactory condition.  Cord bloods were taken.,Placenta was delivered spontaneously and found to be intact.  Uterus was explored and found to be empty.  Uterus was delivered through the abdominal incision and massaged vigorously.  Intravenous Pitocin was administered.  T clamps were placed about the margins of the uterine incision, which was closed primarily with a running locking stitch of 0 Vicryl with adequate hemostasis.  Secondary running locking stitch was placed for extra strength to the wound.  At this point, attention was diverted to the patient's tubes, a Babcock clamp grasped the isthmic portion of each tube and approximately 1-cm knuckle on either side was tied off with two lengths of 0 plain catgut.  Intervening knuckle was excised and passed off the field.  The proximal end of the tubal mucosa was cauterized.  Cul-de-sac and gutters were suctioned vigorously.  The uterus was returned to its proper anatomic position in the abdomen.  The fascia was closed with a simple running stitch of 0 PDS.,The skin was closed with running subcuticular of 4-0 Monocryl.  Uterus was expressed of its contents.  Patient was brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.  There was 600 cc of blood loss.  All sponge, needle, and instrument counts were reported to be correct.,SPECIMEN: , Tubal segments.,DRAIN: , Foley catheter draining clear yellow urine.
CC:, Headache,HX: ,37 y/o RHF presented to her local physician with a one month history of intermittent predominantly left occipital headaches which were awakening her in the early morning hours. The headachese were dull to throbbing in character. She was initially treated with Parafon-forte for tension type headaches, but the pain did not resolve. She subsequently underwent HCT in early 12/90 which revealed a right frontal mass lesion.,PMH: ,1)s/p tonsillectomy. 2)s/p elective abortion.,FHX:, Mother with breast CA, MA with "bone cancer." AODM both sides of family.,SHX: ,Denied tobacco or illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH. Married with 2 teenage children.,EXAM: ,VItal signs unremarkable.,MS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Lucid thought process per NSG note.,CN: unremarkable.,Motor: full strength with normal muscle bulk and tone.,Sensory: unremarkable.,Coordination: unremarkable.,Station/Gait: unremarkable.,Reflexes: unremarkable.,Gen. Exam: unremarkable.,COURSE:, MRI Brain: large solid and cystic right frontal lobe mass with a large amount of surrounding edema. There is apparent tumor extension into the corpus callosum across the midline. Tumor extension is also suggested in the anterior limb of the interanl capsule on the right. There is midline mass shift to the left with effacement of the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. The MRI findings are most consistent with glioblastoma.,The patient underwent right frontal lobectomy. The pathological diagnosis was xanthomatous astrocytoma. The literature at the time was not clear as to optimal treatment protocol. People have survived as long as 25 years after diagnosis with this type of tumor. XRT was deferred until 11/91 when an MRI and PET Scan suggested extension of the tumor. She then received 5580 cGy of XRT in divided segments. She developed olfactory auras shortly after lobectomy at was treated with PB with subsequent improvement. She was treated with BCNU chemotherapy protocol in 1992.
HISTORY: , The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.,On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.,OBJECTIVE:,  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.,2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.,MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ.  If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future.
HISTORY:,  I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Seasonal allergies, possible food allergies, chronic sinusitis, hypertension and history of weight change.  She is currently 180 pounds.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Lower extremity vein stripping, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease and alcoholism.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , DynaCirc.,ALLERGIES: , Egg-based products cause hives.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient used to smoke cigarettes for about 20 years, one-half pack a day.  She currently does not, which was encouraged to continue.  She rarely drinks any alcohol-containing beverages.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 50, blood pressure is 136/74, pulse 84, temperature is 98.4, weight is 180 pounds, and height is 5 feet 3 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.  No nystagmus.,EARS:  During Hallpike examination, the patient did not become dizzy until she would be placed back into sitting in the upright position.  No nystagmus was appreciated; however, the patient did subjectively report dizziness, which was repeated twice.  No evidence of any orthostatic hypotension was noted during the exam.  Tympanic membranes were noted to be intact.  No signs of middle ear effusion or ear canal inflammation.,NOSE:  The patient appears congested.  Turbinate hypertrophy is noted.  There are no signs of any acute sinusitis.  Septum is midline, slightly deviated to the left.,THROAT:  There is clear postnasal drip.  Oral hygiene is good.  No masses or lesions noted.  Both vocal cords move well to midline.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,PROCEDURE: , Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy identifying turbinate hypertrophy and nasal septum deviation to the left, more significant posteriorly.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Probable increasing problems with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, both contributing to the patient's symptoms.,2.  Subjective dizziness, etiology uncertain; however, consider positional vertigo versus vestibular neuronitis as possible ear causes of dizziness, cannot rule out systemic, central or medication or causes at this time.,3.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.,4.  Nasal septum deformity.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  An ENG was ordered to evaluate vestibular function.  She was placed on Veramyst nasal spray two sprays each nostril daily and even twice daily if symptoms are worsening.  A Medrol Dosepak was prescribed as directed.  The patient was given instruction on use of nasal saline irrigation to be used twice daily and Clarinex 5 mg daily was recommended.  After the patients' ENG examination, we will see the patient back for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  In light of the patient's atypical dizziness symptoms, I cannot rule out other pathology at this time, and I informed her if there are any acute changes or problems with regards to her balance or any other acute changes, which she attributes associated with her dizziness, she most likely should pursue an emergent visit to the emergency room.,Thank you for allowing me to participate with the care of your patient.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Request for cosmetic surgery.,2.  Facial asymmetry following motor vehicle accident.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Request for cosmetic surgery.,2.  Facial asymmetry following motor vehicle accident.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Endoscopic subperiosteal midface lift using the endotine midface suspension device.,2.  Transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty with removal of a portion of the medial and middle fat pad.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 28-year-old country and western performer who was involved in a motor vehicle accident over a year ago.  Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.

No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,SKIN:  Significant environmental actinic skin damage.,I recommended excision of basal cell cancers with frozen section control of the margin, closure will require local tissue flaps.  I recommended exchange of the implants with reaugmentation.  No final size is guaranteed or implied.  We will decrease the size of the implants based on the intraoperative findings as the size is not known.  Several options are available.  Sizer implants will be placed to best estimate postoperative size.  Ptosis will be worse following capsulectomy and going with a smaller implant.  She may require a lift in the future.  We have obtained preoperative clearance from the patient's cardiologist, Dr. K.  The patient has been taken off Coumadin for five days and will be placed back on Coumadin the day after the surgery.  The risk of deep venous thrombosis is discussed.  Other risk including bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, pain, scarring, hypertrophic scarring and poor cosmetic resolve, worsening of ptosis, exposure, extrusion, the rupture of the implants, numbness of the nipple-areolar complex, hematoma, need for additional surgery, recurrent capsular contracture and recurrence of the skin cancer was all discussed, which she understands and informed consent is obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After appropriate informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the preoperative holding area with **** input.  She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  TED hose and SCDs were placed.  After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin.  These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.,After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin.  They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement.  Undermining was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene.  Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made.  Dissection was carried down to the capsule.  It was extremely calcified.  Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed.  The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone.  Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured.  No marking as to the size of the implant was found.,Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold.  Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket.  In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left.  Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured.  No marking was found for the size of the implant.  The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams.  Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams.  The implants appeared to be double lumen with the saline portion deflated.  Completion of the capsulectomy was performed on the left.

TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,1.  Secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant with penetrating keratoplasty.,2.  A concurrent vitrectomy and endolaser was performed by the vitreoretinal team.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  ,The patient is a 62-year-old white male who underwent cataract surgery in 09/06.  This was complicated by posterior capsule rupture.  An intraocular lens implant was not attempted.  He developed corneal edema and a preretinal hemorrhage.  He is aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery and now wishes to proceed with secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant in the left eye, vitrectomy, endolaser, and penetrating keratoplasty.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.  Preretinal hemorrhage.,2.  Diabetic retinopathy.,3.  Aphakia.,4.  Corneal edema.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.  Preretinal hemorrhage.,2.  Diabetic retinopathy.,3.  Aphakia.,4.  Corneal edema.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,SPECIMEN:  ,1.  Donor corneal swab sent to Microbiology.,2.  Donor corneal scar rim sent to Eye Pathology.,3.  The patient's cornea sent to Eye Pathology.,PROS DEV IMPLANT:  ,ABC Laboratories 16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,NARRATIVE: , Informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.  No qualified resident was available to assist.
PROCEDURE: , Placement of left ventriculostomy via twist drill.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Massive intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Massive intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a man with a history of massive intracranial hemorrhage and hydrocephalus with intraventricular hemorrhage.  His condition is felt to be critical.  In a desperate attempt to relieve increased intracranial pressure, we have proposed placing a ventriculostomy.  I have discussed this with patient's wife who agrees and asked that we proceed emergently.,After a sterile prep, drape, and shaving of the hair over the left frontal area, this area is infiltrated with local anesthetic.  Subsequently a 1 cm incision was made over Kocher's point.  Hemostasis was obtained.  Then a twist drill was made over this area.  Bones strips were irrigated away.  The dura was perforated with a spinal needle.,A Camino monitor was connected and zeroed.  This was then passed into the left lateral ventricle on the first pass.  Excellent aggressive very bloody CSF under pressure was noted.  This stopped, slowed, and some clots were noted.  This was irrigated and then CSF continued.  Initial opening pressures were 30, but soon arose to 80 or a 100.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The wound was stitched shut and the ventricular drain was then connected to a drainage bag.,Platelets and FFP as well as vitamin K have been administered and ordered simultaneously with the placement of this device to help prevent further clotting or bleeding.
HISTORY:  ,We had the pleasure of seeing the patient today in our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic.  He was sent here with a chief complaint of joint pain in several joints for few months.  This is a 7-year-old white male who has no history of systemic disease, who until 2 months ago, was doing well and 2 months ago, he started to complain of pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck.  At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point.  He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid.  There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems.  He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it.  Other than that, he has not had any other problem.  Denies any swelling except for that doctor mentioned swelling on his elbow.  There is no history of rash, no stomach pain, no diarrhea, no fevers, no weight loss, no ulcers in his mouth except for canker sores.  No lymphadenopathy, no eye problems, and no urinary problems.,MEDICATIONS: , His medications consist only of Motrin only as needed and Claritin currently for seasonal allergies and rhinitis.,ALLERGIES: , He has no allergies to any drugs.,BIRTH HISTORY:  ,Pregnancy and delivery with no complications.

It has normal uric acid, sedimentation rate of 2, rheumatoid factor of 6, and antinuclear antibody that is negative and C-reactive protein that is 7.1.  His mother stated that this was done while he was having symptoms.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This patient may have had reactive arthritis.  He is seen frequently and the patient has family history of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis.  I do not see any problems at this moment on his laboratories or on his physical examination.  This may have been related to recent episode of viral infection or infection of some sort.  Mother was oriented about the finding and my recommendation is to observe him and if there is any recurrence of the symptoms or persistence of swelling or limitation in any of his joints, I will be glad to see him back.,If you have any question on further assessment and plan, please do no hesitate to contact us.
CC:, Headache and diplopia.,HX:, This 39 y/o African American female began experiencing severe constant pressure pain type headaches beginning the last week of 8/95. The pain localized to bifronto-temporal regions of the head and did not radiate. There was no associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia. The HA's occurred daily; and throughout daylight hours. They diminished at bedtime, but occasionally awakened her in the morning.,Several days following the onset of her HA's, she began experiencing numbness and tingling about the right side of her face. These symptoms improved, but did not completely resolved.,Several days after the onset of facial paresthesias, she began to experience binocular horizontal diplopia. The diplopia resolved when covering either eye, and worsened upon looking toward the right. Coincidentally, she began veering toward the right when walking. She denied any weakness. She had had chronic unsteadiness for many years since developing juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She was unsure whether her unsteadiness was due to poor depth perception in light of her diplopia.,The patient was admitted locally 9/2/95.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Carious teeth #2 and #19 and left mandibular dental abscess.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Carious teeth #2 and #19 and left mandibular dental abscess.,PROCEDURES:,  Extraction of teeth #2 and #19 and incision and drainage of intraoral and extraoral of left mandibular dental abscess.,ANESTHESIA: , General, oral endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DRAINS: , Penrose 0.25 inch intraoral and vestibule and extraoral.,CONDITION:,  Stable to PACU.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  Patient was brought to the operating room, placed on the table in the supine position and after demonstration of an adequate plane of general anesthesia via the oral endotracheal route, patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for an intraoral procedure.  In addition, the extraoral area on the left neck was prepped with Betadine and draped accordingly.  Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the left lower quadrant, total of 3.4 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and Marcaine 1.7 mL of 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  An incision was made with #15 blade in the left submandibular area through the skin and blunt dissection was accomplished with curved mosquito hemostat to the inferior border of the mandible.  No purulent drainage was obtained.  The 0.25 inch Penrose drain was then placed in the extraoral incision and it was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Moving to the intraoral area, periosteal elevator was used to elevate the periosteum from the buccal aspect of tooth #19.  The area did not drain any purulent material.  The carious tooth #19 was then extracted by elevator and forceps extraction.  After the tooth was removed, the 0.25 inch Penrose drain was placed in a subperiosteal fashion adjacent to the extraction site and secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The tube was then repositioned to the left side allowing access to the upper right quadrant where tooth #2 was then extracted by routine elevator and forceps extraction.  After the extraction, the throat pack was removed.  An orogastric tube was then placed by Dr. X, and stomach contents were suctioned.  The pharynx was then suctioned with the Yankauer suction.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and taken to the PACU in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Lumbar osteomyelitis.,2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Lumbar osteomyelitis.,2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE:,  Placement of left subclavian 4-French Broviac catheter.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a toddler admitted with a limp and back pain, who was eventually found on bone scan and septic workup to have probable osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine at disk areas.  The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.
MULTISYSTEM EXAM,CONSTITUTIONAL: , The vital signs showed that the patient was afebrile; blood pressure and heart rate were within normal limits.  The patient appeared alert.,EYES: , The conjunctiva was clear.  The pupil was equal and reactive.  There was no ptosis.

CC: ,Gait difficulty.,HX: ,This 59 y/o RHF was admitted with complaint of gait difficulty. The evening prior to admission she noted sudden onset of LUE and LLE weakness. She felt she favored her right leg, but did not fall when walking. She denied any associated dysarthria, facial weakness, chest pain, SOB, visual change, HA, nausea or vomiting.,PMH:, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, skull fx 1954, HTN, HA.,MEDS: ,none on day of exam.,SHX: ,editorial assistant at newspaper, 40pk-yr Tobacco, no ETOH/Drugs.,FHX: ,noncontributory,ADMIT EXAM: ,P95 R20, T36.6, BP169/104,MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria, Naming-comprehension-reading intact. Euthymic with appropriate affect.,CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light, Fundi flat, VFFTC, EOMI, Face symmetric with intact sensation, Gag-shrug-corneal reflexes intact, Tongue ML with full ROM,Motor: Full strength throughout right side. Mildly decreased left grip and left extensor hallucis longus. Biceps/Triceps/Wrist flexors and extensor were full strength on left. However she demonstrated mild LUE pronator drift and had difficulty standing on her LLE despite full strength on bench testing of the LLE.,Sensory: No deficit to PP/T/Vib/Prop/ LT,Coord: decreased speed and magnitude of FNF, Finger tapping and HKS, on left side only.,Station: mild LUE upward drift.,Gait: tendency to drift toward the left. Difficulty standing on LLE.,Reflexes were symmetric, plantar responses were flexor bilaterally.,Gen exam unremarkable.,COURSE: ,Admit Labs: ESR, PT/PTT, GS, UA, EKG, and HCT were unremarkable. Hgb 13.9, Hct 41%, Plt 280k, WBC 5.5.,The patient was diagnosed with a probable lacunar stroke and entered into the TOAST study (Trial of ORG10172[a low molecular weight heparin] in Acute Stroke Treatment).,Carotid Duplex: 16-49%RICA and 0-15%LICA stenosis with anterograde vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a left to right shunt. There was no evidence of blood clot.,Hospital course: 5 days after admission the patient began to complain of proximal LLE and left flank pain. On exam, she had weakness of the quadriceps and hip flexors of the LLE. Her pain increased with left hip flexion. In addition, she complained of paresthesias about the lateral aspect of the medial anterior left thigh; and upon on sensory testing, she had decreased PP/TEMP sensation in a left femoral nerve distribution. She denied any back/neck pain and the rest of her neurologic exam remained unchanged from admission.,Abdominal CT Scan, 2/4/96, revealed a large left retroperitoneal iliopsoas hematoma.,Hgb 8.9g/dl. She was transfused with 4 units of pRBCs. She underwent surgical decompression and evacuation of the hematoma via a posterior flank approach on 2/6/96. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was discharged home on ASA.,At follow-up, on 2/23/96, she complained of left sided paresthesias (worse in the LLE than in the LUE) and feeling of "swollen left foot." These symptoms had developed approximately 1 month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal and her UE strength was 5/4+ proximally and distally, and LE strength 5/4+ proximally and 5/5- distally. She was ambulatory. There was no evidence of LUE upward drift. A somatosensory evoked potential study revealed an absent N20 and normal P14 potentials. This was suggestive of a lesion involving the right thalamus which might explain her paresthesia/dysesthesia as part of a Dejerine-Roussy syndrome.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left.  The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well.  The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago.  She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot.  The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart.  Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds.  She has palpable pulses.  Neurologic sensation is intact.  Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy.  There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement.  She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right.  Gait analysis:  The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet.,X-RAY INTERPRETATION:,  X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy.  Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle.  No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted.  Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot.,2.  Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet.,PLAN/TREATMENT:,1.  Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment.  The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy  at the second metatarsal.  Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications.  The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well.,2.  The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date.,3.  All questions were answered.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Postoperative wound infection.,2.  Left gluteal abscess.,3.  Intraperitoneal pigtail catheter.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Postoperative wound infection.  There was an intraperitoneal foreign body.,2.  Left gluteal abscess.,3.  Intraperitoneal pigtail catheter.,PROCEDURES,1.  Incision and drainage (I&D) of gluteal abscess.,2.  Removal of pigtail catheter.,3.  Limited exploratory laparotomy with removal of foreign body and lysis of adhesions.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Under general endotracheal anesthesia, first of all the patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus and the left gluteal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The opening of the abscess was probed and there was a tract of about 20 cm going subcutaneously upward.  I proceeded to enlarge the drainage area and to some degree unroofing the tract partially and then the area was dbrided and then packed with iodoform gauze and a temporary dressing was applied.,Then, the patient was placed in a supine position, and I proceeded to remove the pigtail catheter after dividing it to undo its locking mechanism.  It came out without any difficulty.  Then, the colostomy was protected and draped apart, and the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  My initial idea was to just drain and debride the wound infection, which had a sinus tract at lower end of the midline incision.  I initially probed the wound with a hemostat and this had at least 12 cm long tract and I proceeded to excise the badly scarred skin that was on top of it and then continued the dissection to the fascia and I realized that the sinus tract was going through the fascia into the abdomen.  Very carefully, I started dividing the fascia.  Of course, there were several small bowel loops adhered to the area.  The dissection was quite tedious for a while.  Initially, I thought that may be there was an enterocutaneous fistula in the area, but then I realized that the tissue that was interpreted as an intestinal mucosa was actually a very smooth __________ tissue that was walling the sinus tract.  I made a laparotomy of about 10 cm and I carefully dissected the bowel of the fascia.  There was an area at the bottom which looked like a foreign body and initially I thought there was a mesh that can be used to close the abdomen, but later on this substance floated out by self and it was an elongated strip, maybe about 6 cm, which we sent to Pathology for examination.  Initially, I have obtained a sample for culture and sensitivity for aerobic and anaerobic organisms.,I was very happy that we were not really dealing with enterocutaneous fistula.  The area was irrigated generously with saline and then we closed the fascia with number of interrupted figure-of-eight sutures of heavy PPS.  The subcutaneous tissue and the skin were left open and packed with Betadine-soaked sponges.,A dressing was applied.  A small dressing was applied to the area where we removed the pigtail catheter and also we went down to the gluteal area and put a formal dressing in that area.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was minimal, and he was sent to the ICU and also made acute care because of the need for a laparotomy, which we were not anticipating.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,1.  Left endoscopic carpal tunnel release.,2.  Endotracheal fasciotomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 62-year-old lady with the aforementioned diagnosis refractory to nonoperative management.  All risks and benefits were explained.  Questions answered.  Options discussed.  No guarantees were made.  She wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease.  Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion.  Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis.  I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally.  I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area.  Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side.  Great care was taken with placement.  A good plane was positively identified.  I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament.,Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me.  I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament.  I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified.  I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament.  I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament.  I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect.  I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time.  Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut.  Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut.  Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin.  The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Epigastric hernia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Epigastric hernia.,OPERATIONS:,  Epigastric herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , General inhalation.,PROCEDURE: , Following attainment of satisfactory anesthesia, the patient's abdomen was prepped with Hibiclens and draped sterilely.  The hernia mass had been marked preoperatively.  This area was anesthetized with a mixture of Marcaine and Xylocaine.  A transverse incision was made over the hernia and dissection carried down to the entrapped fat.  Sharp dissection was carried around the fat down to the fascial edge.  The preperitoneal fat could not be reduced; therefore, it is trimmed away and the small fascial defect then closed with interrupted 0-Ethibond sutures.  The fascial edges were injected with the local anesthetic mixture.  Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl and skin edges closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing were applied to complete the closure.  The patient was then awakened and taken to the PACU in satisfactory condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 10 mL.,SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNT: , Reported as correct.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:  ,Suspicious calcifications upper outer quadrant, left breast.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 78-year-old woman who had undergone routine screening mammography on 06/04/08.  That study disclosed the presence of punctate calcifications that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 o'clock position.  Additional imaging studies confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcifications.  The patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 o'clock position on 06/17/08.  The final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis.  No calcifications could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissue.,Two days post stereotactic core needle biopsy, however, the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast.  She underwent sonographic evaluation and was found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy.  I was called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center.  At the same time, Dr. Y was consulted in Interventional Radiology.  Dr. Z and Dr. Y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this was injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material.  This resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm.  The patient was seen in my office for followup appointment on 06/24/08.  At that time, the patient continued to have signs of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis, which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy.  There was, however, no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm.  There was no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest wall.,I discussed the issues with the patient and her husband.  The underlying problem is that the suspicious calcifications, which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy; therefore, the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging findings.  For this reason, the patient was advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization.  Since the breast mound was significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy, the decision was to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four months.  The patient now returns to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcifications.,The patient has a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast, which was performed on 01/27/04.  This revealed benign histologic findings.  The family history is positive involving a daughter who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40.  Other than her age, the patient has no other risk factors for development of breast cancer.  She is not receiving any hormone replacement therapy.  She has had five children with the first pregnancy occurring at the age of 24.  Other than her daughter, there are no other family members with breast cancer.  There are no family members with a history of ovarian cancer.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Other hospitalizations have occurred for issues with asthma and pneumonia.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Colon resection in 1990 and sinus surgeries in 1987, 1990 and 2005.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.

Family history is positive for colon cancer affecting her father and a brother.  The patient has a daughter who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient does not smoke.  She does have an occasional alcoholic beverage.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,The patient has multiple medical problems, for which she is under the care of Dr. X.  She has a history of chronic obstructive lung disease and a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  There is a history of anemia and there is a history of sciatica, which has been caused by arthritis.  The patient has had skin cancers, which have been treated with local excision.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly aged female who is alert and in no distress.,HEENT:  Head, normocephalic.  Eyes, PERRL.  Sclerae are clear.  Mouth, no oral lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,HEART:  Regular sinus rhythm.,CHEST:  Fair air entry bilaterally.  No wheezes are noted on examination.,BREASTS:  Normal topography bilaterally.  There are no palpable abnormalities in either breast mound.  Nipple areolar complexes are normal.  Specifically, the left breast upper outer quadrant near the 2 o'clock position has no palpable masses.  The previous tissue changes from the stereotactic core needle biopsy have resolved.  Axillary examination normal bilaterally without suspicious lymphadenopathy or masses.,ABDOMEN:  Obese.  No masses.  Normal bowel sounds are present.,BACK:  No CVA tenderness.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Left breast mound clustered calcifications, suspicious by imaging located in the upper outer quadrant at the 2 o'clock position.,2.  Prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast did not resolve the nature of the calcifications, this now requires excision of the tissue with preoperative guidewire localization.,3.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Thickened endometrium and tamoxifen therapy.,2.  Adnexal cyst.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Thickened endometrium and tamoxifen therapy.,2.  Adnexal cyst.,3.  Endometrial polyp.,4.  Right ovarian cyst.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Dilation and curettage (D&C).,2.  Hysteroscopy.,3.  Laparoscopy with right salpingooophorectomy and aspiration of cyst fluid.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 20 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 44-year-old gravida 2, para 1-1-1-2 female who was diagnosed with breast cancer in December of 2002.  She has subsequently been on tamoxifen.  Ultrasound did show a thickened endometrial stripe as well as an adnexal cyst.  The above procedures were therefore performed.,FINDINGS:  ,On bimanual exam, the uterus was found to be slightly enlarged and anteverted.  The external genitalia was normal.  Hysteroscopic findings revealed both ostia well visualized and a large polyp on the anterolateral wall of the endometrium.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a normal-appearing uterus and normal left ovary.  There was no evidence of endometriosis on the ovaries bilaterally, the ovarian fossa, the cul-de-sac, or the vesicouterine peritoneum.  There was a cyst on the right ovary which appeared simple in nature.  The cyst was aspirated and the fluid was blood tinged.  Therefore, the decision to perform oophorectomy was made.  The liver margins appeared normal and there were no pelvic or abdominal adhesions noted.  The polyp removed from the hysteroscopic portion of the exam was found to be 4 cm in size.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the posterior vaginal vault in the 12 o'clock position and the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then sounded in the anteverted position to 10 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank and Hegar dilators up to a Hank dilator of 20 and Hagar dilator of 10.  The hysteroscope was then inserted and the above findings were noted.  A sharp curette was then introduced and the 4 cm polyp was removed.  The hysteroscope was then reinserted and the polyp was found to be completely removed at this point.  The polyp was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed as a means to manipulate the uterus.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Using a sterile saline drop test, appropriate placement was confirmed.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume inflow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was placed without difficulty.  The above findings were then visualized.  A 5 mm port was placed 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was done under direct visualization and the grasper was inserted through this port for better visualization.  A 12 mm port was then made in the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and the Endo-GIA was inserted through this port and the fallopian tube and ovary were incorporated across the infundibulopelvic ligament.  Prior to this, the cyst was aspirated using 60 cc syringe on a needle.  Approximately, 20 cc of blood-tinged fluid was obtained.  After the ovary and fallopian tube were completely transected, this was placed in an EndoCatch bag and removed through the lateral port site.  The incision was found to be hemostatic.  The area was suction irrigated.  After adequate inspection, the port sites were removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was desufflated.  The infraumbilical port site and laparoscope were also removed.  The incisions were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then injected locally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will be followed up on an outpatient basis.
IMPRESSION:,  Abnormal electroencephalogram revealing generalized poorly organized slowing, with more prominent slowing noted at the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions and rare sharp wave activity noted bilaterally, somewhat more prevalent on the right.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:  ,The patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.,BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:,RELEVANT HISTORY:,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with ,the patient.,The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  The patient reports an extensive neurological history.  Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved "honors in school" and "looked smart."  She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  She reported that she will frequently "bang her head against the wall" to relieve the pain.  The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and "thrown two and a half city blocks."  The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  Her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008.  When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal.  She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG.  She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and "tunnel vision" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was "spazzing out" on the floor.  During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel.  She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  She said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  At the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.  The patient is living with her biological mother.  Although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful.  She reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them.,At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient's medication included Ativan, Imitrex, Levoxyl, vitamin B12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and Zofran as needed.  (It should be noted that The patient by the time of the feedback on September 19, 2008 had resumed taking her Trileptal for bipolar disorder.).  The patient's familial medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.,TESTS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Cognistat,Mattis Dementia Rating Scale,Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - III (WAIS-III),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Selected Subtests from the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS),  Trail Making Test,  Verbal Fluency (Letter Fluency & Category Fluency),  Design Fluency,  Color-Word Interference Test,  Tower,Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST),Stroop Test,Color Trails,Trails A & B,Test of Variables of Attention,Multilingual Aphasia Examination II,  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test-2 (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test,The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI),The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Motor Coordination,The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Perception,Judgment Line Orientation,Grooved Pegboard,Purdue Pegboard,Finger Tapping Test,Rey Complex Figure,Wechsler Memory Scale -III (WMS-III),California Verbal Learning Test

The patient identifies recent stressors as having ongoing conflict at work with her administrator with them "cracking down on me." The patient also notes that her longstanding therapy will be temporarily interrupted by the therapist having a child.  She states that her recent depression seems to coincide with her growing knowledge that her therapist was pregnant.  The patient states that she has a tremendous amount of anger towards her therapist for discontinuing or postponing treatment.  She states that she feels "abandoned." The patient notes that it does raise issues with her past, where she had a child at the age of 17 who she gave away for adoption and a second child that she was pregnant by the age of 42 that she aborted at the request of her husband.  The patient states she saw her therapist most recently last Friday.  She sees the therapy weekly and indicates the therapy helps, although she is unable to specify how.

She states she was unliked and unpopular child because she was "shy" and "not smart enough." The patient denies having secrets.  The patient reports that this is her second marriage, which has lasted two years.  Her first marriage lasted I believe it was five years.

The patient is alert and oriented x 3.  Recall is three for three at five minutes.  Proverbs are concrete.  She has fair impulse control, poor judgment, and poor insight.,FORMULATION:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old married white female with no children now presenting with recurrent depressive symptoms and active suicidal ideation and planning.  The patient reports longstanding depressive symptoms that were subthreshold punctuated by periods of more severe depression.  The patient also reports some up periods, which do not meet most criteria for a bipolar disorder or manic states.  The patient notes that current depression started with approximately the same time that she became aware that her therapist was pregnant.  She notes that the current depression is atypical in that it is primarily anger based and she does not have the typical hypersomnia that she gets.  The patient reports being unable to express anger to her therapist and being unable to discuss her feeling regarding the pregnancy.  The patient also states that she feels abandoned with the upcoming discontinuation of treatment while the therapist is giving birth and thereafter.  Symptoms are consistent with a longstanding dysthymia and reoccurring depression.  In addition, diagnosis is highly complicated by presence of a strong personality disorder component, most likely borderline personality disorder.  This latter diagnosis seems to be the most active at this time with the patient acutely reacting to perceived therapist's absence and departure.  This is exacerbated by instability in the patient's marital life.,DIAGNOSIS:,Axis I:  Dysthymia.  Major depression, moderate severity, recurrent, with partial remission.,Axis II:  Borderline personality disorder.,Axis III:  Hypothyroidism and cervical disc herniation and sinus surgery.,Axis IV:  Medical access.  Marital discord.,Axis V:  A GAF of 30.,PLAN:  ,The patient is unlikely to have bipolar disorder.  We will recommend the patient's thyroid be rechecked to ensure she is currently euthymic.  We would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient's reaction to her therapist's departure.  We would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave.  We would recommend continued treatment with SSRIs for dysthymia and depression.  We would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as Prozac, given the patient's ambivalence regarding medications.  Prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg.  We might also supplement the Prozac with a (anti-sleep medication).,Time spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED,1.  Insertion of subclavian dual-port Port-A-Cath.,2.  Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the chest was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  A #18-gauge spinal needle was used to aspirate blood from the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, Seldinger technique was used to thread a J wire.  The distal tip of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to make an incision in the skin.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the pectoralis muscle.  A pocket was created.  A dual-port Port-A-Cath was lowered into the pocket and secured with #2-0 Prolene.  Both ports were flushed.  The distal tip was pulled through to the wire exit site with a Kelly clamp.  It was cut to the appropriate length.  Next a dilator and sheath were threaded over the J wire.  The J wire and dilator were removed, and the distal tip of the dual-port Port-A-Cath was threaded over the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  Both ports of the dual-port Port-A-Cath were flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  The wire access site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The port pocket was closed in 2 layers with 2-0 Vicryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Oropharyngeal foreign body.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Foreign body, left vallecula at the base of the tongue.,2.  Airway is patent and stable.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Flexible nasal laryngoscopy.,ANESTHESIA:,  ______ with viscous lidocaine nasal spray.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 39-year-old Caucasian male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with acute onset of odynophagia and globus sensation.  The patient stated his symptoms began around mid night after returning home _________ ingesting some chicken.  The patient felt that he had ingested a chicken bone, tried to dislodge this with fluids and other solid foods as well as sticking his finger down his throat without success.  The patient subsequently was seen in the Emergency Department where it was discovered that the patient had a left vallecular foreign body.  Department of Otolaryngology was asked to consult for further evaluation and treatment of this foreign body.,PROCEDURE: , After verbal informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the upright position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was inserted in the patient's right naris and then the left naris.  There was visualized some bilateral caudal spurring of the septum.  The turbinates were within normal limits.  There was some posterior nasoseptal deviation to the left.  The nasal laryngoscope was then inserted back into the right naris and it was advanced along the floor of the nasal cavity.  The nasal mucous membranes were pink and moist.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.,The scope was further advanced to the level of the nasopharynx where the eustachian tubes were visualized bilaterally.  There was evidence of some mild erythema in the right fossa Rosenmller.  There was no evidence of mass lesion or ulceration in this area, however.  The eustachian tubes were patent without obstruction.  The scope was further advanced to the level of the oropharynx where the base of the tongue, vallecula, and epiglottis were visualized.  There was evidence of a 1.5 cm left vallecular white foreign body.  The rest of the oropharynx was without abnormality.  The epiglottis was within normal limits and was noted to be omega in shape.  There was no edema or erythema to the epiglottis.  The scope was then further advanced to the level of the hypopharynx to the level of the true vocal cords.  There was no evidence of erythema or edema of the posterior commissure, arytenoid cartilage, or superior surface of the vocal cords.  The laryngeal surface of the epiglottis was within normal limits.  There was no evidence of mass lesion or nodularity of the vocal cords.  The patient was asked to Valsalva and the piriform sinuses were observed without evidence of foreign body or mass lesion.  The patient did have complete glottic closure upon phonation and the airway was patent and stable throughout the exam.  The glottic aperture was completely patent with inspiration.  The anterior commissure, epiglottic folds, false vocal cords, and piriform sinuses were all within normal limits.  The scope was then removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.,FINDINGS:,1.  A 1.5 cm white foreign body consistent with a chicken bone at the left vallecular region.  There is no evidence of supraglottic or piriform sinuses foreign body.,2.  Mild erythema of the right nasopharynx in the region of the fossa Rosenmller.  No mass is appreciated at this time.,PLAN:,  The patient is to go to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy/microscopic suspension direct laryngoscopy for removal of foreign body under anesthesia this a.m.  Airway precautions were instituted.  The patient currently remained in stable condition.

EXTERNAL EXAMINATION: , The autopsy is begun at 8:30 A.M. on May 24, 2004. The body is presented in a black body bag. The victim is wearing a white sleeveless turtleneck shirt and navy blue sweatpants. Jewelry included two smooth-textured silver hoop pierced earrings, 1-inch diameter, one in each ear, and one 1-inch wide silver expandable wristband on left wrist. A 1.5-inch wide tan belt with green stripes is cinched around the upper neck using the buckle. The opposite end of the belt is tied in a half-hitch knot, which was used to affix it to the crossbar in the closet where the body was found. ,The body is that of a normally developed white female measuring 67 inches and weighing 118 pounds, and appearing generally consistent with the stated age of twenty-six years. The body is cold and unembalmed. Lividity is fixed in the distal portions of the limbs. The eyes are open. The irises are brown and corneas are cloudy. Petechial hemorrhaging is present in the conjunctival surfaces of the eyes. The pupils measure 0.3 cm. The hair is dark blonde with lighter blonde highlights, wavy, layered and approximately 11 inches in length at the longest point. ,Removal of the belt revealed a ligature mark (known throughout this report as Ligature A) on the neck below the mandible. Ligature A is approximately 1.5 inches wide and encircles the neck in the form of a "V" on the anterior of the neck and an inverted "V" on the posterior of the neck, consistent with hanging. Minor abrasions are present in the area of Ligature A. Lack of hemorrhage surrounding Ligature A indicates this injury to be post-mortem. ,Upon removal of the victim's clothing, an odor of bleach was detected. Areas of the body were swabbed and submitted for detection of hypochlorite. Following removal of the shirt, a second ligature mark (known throughout this report as Ligature B) was observed on the victim's neck. The mark is dark red ligature and encircles the neck, crossing the anterior midline of the neck just below the laryngeal prominence. The width of the mark varies between 0.8 and 1cm and is horizontal in orientation. The skin of the anterior neck above and below the ligature mark shows petechial hemorrhaging. Ligature B is not consistent with the belt that caused Ligature A. The absence of abrasions associated with Ligature B, along with the variations in the width of the ligature mark, are consistent with a soft ligature, such as a length of fabric. No trace evidence was recovered from Ligature B that might assist in identification of the ligature used. ,The genitalia are that of an adult female and there is no evidence of injury. Pubic hair has been shaved in its entirety within six hours of death. Limbs are equal, symmetrically developed and show no evidence of injury. The fingernails are medium length and fingernail beds are blue. There are no residual scars, markings or tattoos.,INTERNAL EXAMINATION:  ,HEAD--CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: ,Subsequent autopsy shows a broken hyoid bone. Hemorrhaging from Ligature B penetrates the skin and subdermal tissues of the neck. The brain weighs 1,303 grams and within normal limits. ,SKELETAL SYSTEM:, The hyoid bone is fractured. ,RESPIRATORY SYSTEM--THROAT STRUCTURES: ,The oral cavity shows no lesions. Petechial hemorrhaging is present in the mucosa of the lips and the interior of the mouth. Otherwise, the mucosa is intact and there are no injuries to the lips, teeth or gums. ,There is no obstruction of the airway. The mucosa of the epiglottis, glottis, piriform sinuses, trachea and major bronchi are anatomic. No injuries are seen and there are no mucosal lesions. The hyoid bone, the thyroid, and the cricoid cartilages are fractured. ,The lungs weigh: right, 355 grams; left 362 grams. The lungs are unremarkable. ,CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: ,The heart weighs 253 grams, and has a normal size and configuration. No evidence of atherosclerosis is present. ,GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM: ,The mucosa and wall of the esophagus are intact and gray-pink, without lesions or injuries. The gastric mucosa is intact and pink without injury. Approximately 125 ml of partially digested semisolid food is found in the stomach. The mucosa of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum are intact. ,URINARY SYSTEM: ,The kidneys weigh: left, 115 grams; right, 113 grams. The kidneys are anatomic in size, shape and location and are without lesions. ,FEMALE GENITAL SYSTEM: ,The structures are within normal limits. Examination of the pelvic area indicates the victim had not given birth and was not pregnant at the time of death. There is evidence of recent sexual activity but no indications that the sexual contact was forcible. Vaginal fluid samples are removed for analysis. ,TOXICOLOGY: ,Sample of right pleural blood and bile are submitted for toxicologic analysis. Stomach contents are saved. ,SEROLOGY:, A sample of right pleural blood is submitted in the EDTA tube. Routine toxicologic studies were ordered.,LABORATORY DATA,CEREBROSPINAL FLUID CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY:,Gram stain: Unremarkable,Culture: No growth after 72 hours,CEREBROSPINAL FLUID BACTERIAL ANTIGENS:,Hemophilus influenza B: Negative,Streptococcus pneumoniae: Negative,N.

EXAM: , Barium enema.,CLINICAL HISTORY: , A 4-year-old male with a history of encopresis and constipation.,TECHNIQUE:  ,A single frontal scout radiograph of the abdomen was performed.  A rectal tube was inserted in usual sterile fashion, and retrograde instillation of barium contrast was followed via spot fluoroscopic images.  A post-evacuation overhead radiograph of the abdomen was performed.,FINDINGS:,  The scout radiograph demonstrates a nonobstructive gastrointestinal pattern.  There are no suspicious calcifications seen or evidence of gross free intraperitoneal air.  The visualized lung bases and osseous structures are within normal limits.,The rectum and colon is of normal caliber throughout its course.  There is no evidence of obstruction, as contrast is seen to flow without difficulty into the right colon and cecum.  A small amount of contrast is seen to opacify small bowel loops on the post-evacuation image.  There is also opacification of a normal-appearing appendix documented.,IMPRESSION: , Normal barium enema.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  This 71-year-old man went to his primary care physician for a routine physical.  His only complaints were nocturia times two and a gradual "slowing down" feeling.  The physical examination on 1/29 was within normal limits except for the digital rectal exam which revealed an asymmetric prostate gland with nodularity, R>L.  PSA was elevated.  The differential diagnosis for the visit was abnormal prostate, suggestive of CA.,IMAGING:  ,CT pelvis:  Irregular indentation of bladder.  Seminal vesicles enlarged.

SUBJECTIVE: , The patient states that she feels better.  She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient's managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysm.,OPERATION/PROCEDURE: , A 26-mm Dacron graft replacement of type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysm from T10 to the bifurcation of the aorta, re-implanting the celiac, superior mesenteric artery and right renal as an island and the left renal as a 8-mm interposition Dacron graft, utilizing left heart bypass and cerebrospinal fluid drainage.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Patient was brought to the operating room and put in supine position, and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced through a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed.  The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl.  The fascial layer was closed with running #1 Prolene, subcu with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.
EXAM:  ,Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy.,HISTORY: , 30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder.  The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.  Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.,3.  Suspicious mammographic findings.  The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied.  Further pathologic analysis is pending.,BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.,MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:,1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.,2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.,3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.

Cervical spine sprain/strain.,2.  Lumbar spine sprain/strain.,3.  Tension headaches.,CAUSATION:  ,The patient's symptoms appeared to have come on as a result of the motor vehicle accident consistent with the one described in this report. His history, subjective, and objective findings show evidence from a medical viewpoint that his condition is due to the current injury only and no contributing factors are present from preexisting conditions. The patient's condition is a result of a bony/soft tissue injury that has resulted in an undetermined impairment at this time.,PROGNOSIS: ,The likelihood of nearly complete symptomatic relief within 90 days is excellent.  The patient should reach maximum medical improvement in three or four months.,TREATMENT/PLAN: ,After completing an initial examination evaluation, I have selected the plan of treatment that should return this patient to a pre-injury status and minimize the possibility of future residuals. Treatment will consist of chiropractic manipulation, chiropractic physical therapy, and observation, decreasing in frequency as the patient's condition allows. I feel it is too early to determine whether this patient will have any residuals or permanent disability.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Right C5-C6 herniated nucleus pulposus.,PRIMARY OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-6 and placement of artificial disk replacement.,SUMMARY:,  This is a pleasant, 43-year-old woman, who has been having neck pain and right arm pain for a period of time which has not responded to conservative treatment including ESIs.  She underwent another MRI and significant degenerative disease at C5-6 with a central and right-sided herniation was noted.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and she wished to proceed with surgery.  She was interested in participating in the artificial disk replacement study and was entered into that study.  She was randomly picked for the artificial disk and underwent the above named procedure on 08/27/2007.  She has done well postoperatively with a sensation of right arm pain and numbness in her fingers.  She will have x-rays AP and lateral this morning which will be reviewed and she will be discharged home today if she is doing well.  She will follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks in the clinic as per the study protocol with cervical AP and lateral x-rays with ring prior to the appointment.  She will contact our office prior to her appointment if she has problems.  Prescriptions were written for Flexeril 10 mg 1 p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.  #50 with 1 refill and Lortab 7.5/500 mg 1 to 2 q.6 h. p.r.n.  #60 with 1 refill.
CC: ,Low Back Pain (LBP) with associated BLE weakness.,HX:, This 75y/o RHM presented with a 10 day h/o progressively worsening LBP. The LBP started on 12/3/95; began radiating down the RLE, on 12/6/95; then down the LLE, on 12/9/95. By 12/10/95, he found it difficult to walk. On 12/11/95, he drove himself to his local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. He was given some NSAID and drove home. By the time he got home he had great difficulty walking due to LBP and weakness in BLE, but managed to feed his pets and himself. On 12/12/95 he went to see a local orthopedist, but on the way to his car he crumpled to the ground due to BLE weakness and LBP pain. He also had had BLE numbness since 12/11/95. He was evaluated locally and an L-S-Spine CT scan and L-S Spine X-rays were "negative." He was then referred to UIHC.,MEDS: ,SLNTC, Coumadin 4mg qd, Propranolol, Procardia XL, Altace, Zaroxolyn.,PMH: ,1) MI 11/9/78, 2) Cholecystectomy, 3) TURP for BPH 1980's, 4) HTN, 5) Amaurosis Fugax, OD, 8/95 (Mayo Clinic evaluation--TEE (-), but Carotid Doppler (+) but "non-surgical" so placed on Coumadin).,FHX:, Father died age 59 of valvular heart disease.

Anal reflex was illicited from all four quadrants. No jaw jerk or palmomental reflexes illicited.,Rectal: normal rectal tone, guaiac negative stool.,GEN EXAM: Bilateral Carotid Bruits, No lymphadenopathy, right inguinal hernia, rhonchi and inspiratory wheeze in both lung fields.,COURSE: ,WBC 11.6, Hgb 13.4, Hct 38%, Plt 295. ESR 40 (normal 0-14), CRP 1.4 (normal <0.4), INR 1.5, PTT 35 (normal), Creatinine 2.1, CK 346. EKG normal. The differential diagnosis included Amyotrophy, Polymyositis, Epidural hematoma, Disc Herniation and Guillain-Barre syndrome. An MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained, 12/13/95. This revealed an L3-4 disc herniation extending inferiorly and behind the L4 vertebral body. This disc was located more on the right than on the left , compromised the right neural foramen, and narrowed the spinal canal. The patient underwent a L3-4 laminectomy and diskectomy and subsequently improved. He was never seen in follow-up at UIHC.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Dysphagia and esophageal spasm.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Esophagitis and esophageal stricture.,PROCEDURE:,  Gastroscopy.,MEDICATIONS:,  MAC.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, to the third portion of the duodenum.  The hypopharynx was normal and the upper esophageal sphincter was unremarkable.  The esophageal contour was normal, with the gastroesophageal junction located at 38 cm from the incisors.  At this point, there were several linear erosions and a sense of stricturing at 38 cm.  Below this, there was a small hiatal hernia with the hiatus noted at 42 cm from the incisors.  The mucosa within the hernia was normal.  The gastric lumen was normal with normal mucosa throughout.  The pylorus was patent permitting passage of the scope into the duodenum, which was normal through the third portion.  During withdrawal of the scope, additional views were obtained of the cardia, confirming the presence of a small hiatal hernia.  It was decided to attempt dilation of the strictured area, so an 18-mm TTS balloon was placed across the stricture and inflated to the recommended diameter.  When the balloon was fully inflated, the lumen appeared to be larger than 18 mm diameter, suggesting that the stricture was in fact not a significant one.  No stretching of the mucosa took place.  The balloon was deflated and the scope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Esophagitis.,2.  Minor stricture at the gastroesophageal junction.,3.  Hiatal hernia.,4.  Otherwise normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,Continue proton pump inhibitor therapy.

Apgars of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively and cord pH is 7.314.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Low transverse C-section.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,DRAINS: , Foley.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal with Duramorph.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 21-year-old white female gravida 1, para 0, who had presented to the hospital at 37-3/7 weeks for induction.  The patient had oligohydramnios and also when placed on the monitor had nonreassuring fetal heart rate with late deceleration.  Due to the IUGR as well a decision for a C-section was made.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a seated position with standard spinal form of anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The patient was then repositioned, prepped and draped in a slight left lateral tilt.  Once this was completed first knife was used to make a low transverse skin incision approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in transverse fashion.  Edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was completed consistent with the Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center, extended in vertical fashion and the peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in vertical fashion.  Bladder blade was put in place and a bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum and pickups and then bluntly dissected via cautery and reincorporated in the bladder blade.  Second knife was used to make a low transverse uterine incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of fetus.  Presenting part was vertex, the head was delivered, followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The mouth and nose were suctioned through bulb syringe and the cord was doubly clamped and cut and then the newborn handed off to waiting nursing personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained.  The placenta was delivered manually and the uterus was externalized and the lining was cleaned off any remaining placental fragments and blood and the incisional edges were reapproximated with 0-chromic and a continuous locking stitch with a second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-peritonized with Gelfoam underneath and abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood and fluid and the edges of the perineum grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitches of 2-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the abdominal rectus muscle as well as the perineum.  This area was then irrigated.  Cautery was used for adequate hemostasis, corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 1-Vicryl was started at both corners and overlapped in the center.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Skin edges reapproximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The uterus was evacuated of any remaining clots vaginally.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct.

The patient already had MRI of the brain and the cervical spine.  MRI of the brain reported negative and cervical spine as shown signs of disk protrusion at C5 and C6 level, which will not explain of the temporal headache.  Plan and followup discussed with the patient in detail.
XYZ, M.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear Dr. XYZ:,Thank you for your kind referral for patient ABC.  The patient is being referred for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.  The patient was just diagnosed with diabetes; however, he does not have any serious visual complaints at this time.,On examination, the patient is seeing 20/40 OD pinholing to 20/20.  The vision in the left eye is 20/20 uncorrected.  Applanation pressures are normal at 17 mmHg bilaterally.  Visual fields are full to count fingers OU and there is no relative afferent pupillary defect.  Slit lamp examination was within normal limits, other than trace to 1+ nuclear sclerosis OU.  On dilated examination, the patient shows a normal cup-to-disc ratio that is symmetric bilaterally.  The macula, vessels, and periphery are also within normal limits.,In conclusion, Mr. ABC does not show any evidence of diabetic retinopathy at this time.  We recommended him to have his eyes dilated once a year.  I have advised him to follow up with you for his regular check-ups.

REASON FOR VISIT:,  The patient presents for a followup for history of erythema nodosum.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum.,The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.,Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States.,In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease.,Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis.,Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed.,Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3.,The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.,MEDICATIONS: , Prednisone was stopped.  Vitamin D and calcium over the counter, we need to verify that.  Colchicine 0.6 mg daily which we are going to stop, ranitidine 150 mg as needed, which she does not take frequently.,FINDINGS:,  On physical examination, she is very pleasant, alert, and oriented x 3 and not in any acute distress.  There is some evidence of faint subcutaneous lesions in both shins bilaterally, but with mild tenderness, but no evidence of classic erythema nodosum.  Stasis dermatitis changes in both lower extremities present.  Mild livedo reticularis is present as well.,There is some periarticular ankle edema as well.  Laboratory data from 04/23/07, show a normal complete metabolic profile with a creatinine of 0.7, a CBC with a white count of 7880, hematocrit of 40.3, and platelets of 228.  Her microcytosis and hypochromia has resolved.  Her serum electrophoresis does not show a monoclonal abnormality.  Her vitamin D levels were 26, which suggests some mild insufficiency and she would probably benefit by vitamin D supplementation.  This points again towards some ileum pathology.  Her ANCA B and C were negative.  Her PF3 and MPO were unremarkable.  Her endomysial antibodies were negative.  Her sed rate at this time were 19.  The highest has been 30, but prior to her appointment here was even higher.  Her ANA continues to be positive with a titer of 1:40, speckled pattern.  Her double-stranded DNA is negative.  Her serum immunofixation confirmed the absence of monoclonal abnormality.  Her urine immunofixation was not performed.  Her IgG, IgA, and IgM levels are normal.  Her IgE levels are normal as well.  A urinalysis was not performed this time.  Her CRP is 0.4.  Her tissue transglutaminase antibodies are negative.  Her ASCA is normal and anti-OmpC was not tested.  Gliadin antibodies IgA is 12, which is in the borderline to be considered equivocal, but these are nonspecific.  I am reminding here that her homocystine levels have been 15.7, slightly higher, and that her methylmalonic acid was 385, which is obviously abnormal.  Her B12 levels were 216, which is rather low possibly indicating a B12 deficiency.  Her iron studies showed a ferritin of 15, a saturation of 9%, and an iron of 30.  Her TIBC was 345 pointing towards an iron deficiency anemia.  I am reminding you that her ACE levels in the past were normal and that she has a microcytosis.  Her radiologic workup including a thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT did not show any suspicious adenopathy, but only small aortocaval and periaortic nodes, the largest being 8 mm in short axis, likely reactive.  Her pelvic ultrasound showed normal uterus adnexa.  Her bladder was normal as well.  Subcentimeter inguinal nodes were found.  There was no large lytic or sclerotic lesion noted.  Her recent endoscopy was unremarkable, but the microscopy showed some eosinophil aggregation, which may be pointing towards allergy or an evolving Crohn disease.  Her capsule endoscopy was limited secondary to rapid transit.  There was only a tiny mucosal red spot in the proximal jejunum without active bleeding, 2 possible erosions were seen in the distal jejunum and proximal ileum.  However, no significant inflammation or bleeding was seen and this could be small bowel crisis.  Neither evidence of bleeding or inflammation were seen as well.  Specifically, the terminal ileum appeared normal.  Recent evaluation by a dermatologist did not verify the presence of erythema nodosum.,ASSESSMENT:,  This is a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004.  She has been treated with prednisone as in the beginning she had also a wrist and ankle discomfort and high inflammatory markers.  Since I took over her care, I have not seen a clear-cut erythema nodosum being present.  No evidence of synovitis was there.  Her serologies apart from an ANA of 1:40 were negative.  She has a livedo pattern, which has been worrisome.  The issue here was a possibility of inflammatory bowel disease based on deficiency in vitamin B12 as indicated by high methylmalonic and homocystine levels and also iron deficiency.  She also has low vitamin D levels, which point towards terminal ileum pathology as well and she had a history of decreased MCV.  We never received the x-ray of her hands which she had and she never had a DEXA scan.  Lymphoma has been ruled out and we believe that inflammatory bowel disease, after repeated colonoscopies and the capsule endoscopy, has been ruled out as well.  Sarcoid is probably not the case since the patient did not have any lymphadenopathies and her ACE levels were normal.  We are going check a PPD to rule out tuberculosis.  We are going to order an RVVT and glycoprotein beta-1 levels in her workup to make sure that an antiphospholipid syndrome is not present given the livedo pattern.  An anti-intrinsic factor will be added as well.  Her primary care physician needs to workup the possible B12 and iron deficiency and also the vitamin D deficiency.  In the meanwhile, we feel that the patient should stop taking the colchicine and if she has a flare of her disease then she should present to her dermatologist and have the skin biopsy performed in order to have a clear-cut answer of what is the nature of this skin rash.  Regarding her heart murmur, we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram.  A PPD should be placed as well.  In her next appointment, we may fax a requisition for vitamin B replacement.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,  1.  Recurrent erythema nodosum with ankle and wrist discomfort, ? arthritis.,2.  Iron deficiencies, according to iron studies.,3.  Borderline B12 with increased methylmalonic acid and homocystine.,4.  On chronic steroids; vitamin D and calcium is needed; she needs a DEXA scan.,5.  Typical ANCA, per records, were not verified here.  ANCA and ASCA were negative and the OmpC was not ordered.,6.  Acne.,7.  Recurrent arthralgia not present.  Rheumatoid factor, CCP negative, ANA 1:40 speckled.,8.  Livedo reticularis, beta 2-glycoprotein was not checked, we are going to check it today.  Needs vaccination for influenza and pneumonia.,9.  Vitamin D deficiency.  She needs replacement with ergocalciferol, but this may point towards ___________ pathology as this was not detected.,10.  Recurrent ankle discomfort which necessitates ankle x-rays.,PLANS:,  We can proceed with part of her workup here in clinic, PPD, echocardiogram, ankle x-rays, and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.  We can start repleting her vitamin D with __________ weeks of ergocalciferol 50,000 weekly.  We can add an RVVT and glycoprotein to her workup in order to rule out any antiphospholipid syndrome.  She should be taking vitamin D and calcium after the completion of vitamin D replacement.  She should be seen by her primary care physician, have the iron and B12 deficiency worked up.  She should stop the colchicine and if the skin lesion recurs then she should be seen by her dermatologist.  Based on the physical examination, we do not suspect that the patient has the presence of any other disease associated with erythema nodosum.  We are going to add an amylase and lipase to evaluate her pancreatic function, RPR, HIV, __________ serologies.  Given the evidence of possible malabsorption it may be significant to proceed with an upper endoscopy to rule out Whipple disease or celiac disease which can sometimes be associated with erythema nodosum.  An anti-intrinsic factor would be added, as I mentioned.  I doubt whether the patient has Behcet disease given the absence of oral or genital ulcers.  She does not give a history of oral contraceptives or medications that could be related to erythema nodosum.  She does not have any evidence of lupus __________ mycosis.  Histoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis would be accompanied by other symptoms.  Hodgkin disease has probably been ruled out with a CAT scan.  However, we are going to add an LDH in future workup.  I need to discuss with her primary care physician regarding the need for workup of her vitamin B12 deficiency and also with her gastroenterologist regarding the need for an upper endoscopy.  The patient will return in 1 month.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pyogenic granuloma, left lateral thigh.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pyogenic granuloma, left lateral thigh.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE: , Excision of recurrent pyogenic granuloma.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is 12-year-old young lady, who has a hand-sized congenital vascular malformation on her left lateral thigh below the greater trochanter, which was described by her parents as a birthmark.  This congenital cutaneous vascular malformation faded substantially over the first years of her life and has regressed to a flat, slightly hyperpigmented lesion.  Although no isolated injury event can be recalled, the patient has developed a pyogenic granuloma next to the distal portion of this lesion on her mid thigh, and it has been treated with topical cautery in her primary care doctor's office, but with recurrence.  She is here today for excision.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had what appeared to be a classic pyogenic granuloma arising from this involuted vascular malformation.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room, had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out, reiterated her important and unique identifying information and confirmed that the excision of the left thigh pyogenic granuloma was the procedure planned for today.  Preparation and draping was __________ ensued with a chlorhexidine based prep solution.  The pyogenic granuloma was approximately 6 to 7 mm in greatest dimension and to remove it required creating an elliptical incision of about 1 to 1.2 cm.  This entire area was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine to provide a wide local field block and then an elliptical incision was made with a #15 scalpel blade, excising the pyogenic granuloma, its base, and a small rim of surrounding normal skin.  Some of the abnormal vessels in the dermal and subdermal layer were cauterized with the needle-tip electrocautery pencil.  The wound was closed in layers with a deep dermal roll of 5-0 Monocryl stitches supplemented by 5-0 intradermal Monocryl and Steri-Strips for final skin closure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  This nodule was submitted to pathology for confirmation of its histology as a pyogenic granuloma.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL and there were no complications.
PROCEDURE: , Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens insertion.,INTRAOCULAR LENS: , Allergan Medical Optics model S140MB XXX diopter chamber lens.,PHACO TIME:,  Not known.,ANESTHESIA: , Retrobulbar block with local minimal anesthesia care.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , While the patient was in the holding area, the operative eye was dilated with four sets of drops.  The drops consisted of Cyclogyl 1%, Acular, and Neo-Synephrine 2.5 %.  Additionally, a peripheral IV was established by the anesthesia team.  Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.,Inside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established.  Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine  plain with 150 units of Wydase.  The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained.  Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.,The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery.  A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids.  With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally.  A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade.  Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove.  The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty.  The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps.  Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.,Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.  The patient is scheduled to be seen in follow-up in the office tomorrow, but should any complications arise this evening, the patient is to contact me immediately.
EXAM: , CT stone protocol.,REASON FOR EXAM:,  History of stones, rule out stones.,TECHNIQUE: , Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis per renal stone protocol.,FINDINGS: , Correlation is made with a prior examination dated 01/20/09.,Again identified are small intrarenal stones bilaterally.  These are unchanged.  There is no hydronephrosis or significant ureteral dilatation.  There is no stone along the expected course of the ureters or within the bladder.  There is a calcification in the low left pelvis not in line with ureter, this finding is stable and is compatible with a phlebolith.  There is no asymmetric renal enlargement or perinephric stranding.,The appendix is normal.  There is no evidence of a pericolonic inflammatory process or small bowel obstruction.,Scans through the pelvis disclose no free fluid or adenopathy.,Lung bases aside from very mild dependent atelectasis appear clear.,Given the lack of contrast, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas are grossly unremarkable.  The gallbladder is present.  There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy.,IMPRESSION:,1. Bilateral intrarenal stones, no obstruction.,2. Normal appendix.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED,1.  Placement of a subclavian single-lumen tunneled Hickman central venous catheter.,2.  Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and anesthesia was administered.  Next, a #18-gauge needle was used to locate the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, a J wire was inserted through the needle using Seldinger technique.  The needle was withdrawn.  The distal tip location of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, a separate stab incision was made approximately 3 fingerbreadths below the wire exit site.  A subcutaneous tunnel was created, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was pulled through the tunnel to the level of the cuff.  The catheter was cut to the appropriate length.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the J wire.  The dilator and J wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Hickman catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in good location with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  A 2-0 nylon was used to secure the cuff down to the catheter at the skin level.  The skin stab site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the postanesthesia recovery area in good condition.
CC:, Found down.,HX:, 54y/o RHF went to bed at 10 PM at her boyfriend's home on 1/16/96. She was found lethargic by her son the next morning. Three other individuals in the house were lethargic and complained of HA that same morning. Her last memory was talking to her granddaughter at 5:00PM on 1/16/96. She next remembered riding in the ambulance from a Hospital. Initial Carboxyhemoglobin level was 24% (normal < 1.5%) and ABG 7.41/30/370 with O2Sat 75% on 100%FiO2.,MEDS:, unknown anxiolytic, estrogen.,PMH:, PUD, ?stroke and memory difficulty in the past 1-2 years.,FHX:, unknown.,SHX:, divorced. unknown history of tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.,EXAM: ,BP126/91, HR86, RR 30, 37.1C.,MS:, Oriented to name only. Speech without dysarthria. 2/3 recall at 5minutes.,CN:, unremarkable.,MOTOR: ,full strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk.,SENSORY: ,unremarkable.,COORD/STATION:, unremarkable.,GAIT:, not tested on admission.,GEN EXAM:, notable for erythema of the face and chest.,COURSE:, She underwent a total of four dives under Hyperbaric Oxygen ( 2 dives on 1/17 and 2 dives on 1/18). Neuropsychologic assessment on 1/18/96 revealed marked cognitive impairments with defects in anterograde memory, praxis, associative fluency, attention, and speed of information processing. She was discharged home on 1/19/96 and returned on 2/11/96 after neurologic deterioration. She progressively developed more illogical behavior, anhedonia, anorexia and changes in sleep pattern. She became completely dependent and could not undergo repeat neuropsychologic assessment in 2/96. She was later transferred to another care facility against medical advice. The etiology for these changes became complicated by a newly discovered history of possible ETOH abuse and usual "anxiety" disorder.,MRI brain, 2/14/96, revealed increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, bilaterally. EEG showed diffuse slowing without epileptiform activity.

He will come for a BMP check in one week.  I asked him to check his blood pressure and weight.  I discussed medication changes and gave him an updated list.  I have asked him to see a gastroenterologist for hepatitis C.  At this point, his Medicaid is pending.  He has no insurance and finds hard to find a primary care provider.  I will see him in one month.  He will have his fasting lipid profile, AST, and ALT checked in one week.
PAST MEDICAL HX: , Significant for asthma, pneumonia, and depression.,PAST SURGICAL HX: , None.,MEDICATIONS:,  Prozac 20 mg q.d.  She desires to be on the NuvaRing.,ALLERGIES:,  Lactose intolerance.,SOCIAL HX: , She denies smoking or alcohol or drug use.,PE:,  VITALS: Stable.  Weight: 114 lb.  Height: 5 feet 2 inches.  GENERAL: Well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  HEENT: Within normal limits. NECK: Supple without thyromegaly.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.  ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender.  There is no rebound or guarding.  No palpable masses and no peritoneal signs.  EXTREMITIES: Within normal limits.  SKIN: Warm and dry.  GU: External genitalia is without lesion.  Vaginal is clean without discharge.  Cervix appears normal; however, a colposcopy was performed using acetic acid, which showed a thick acetowhite ring around the cervical os and extending into the canal.  BIMANUAL: Reveals significant cervical motion tenderness and fundal tenderness.  She had no tenderness in her adnexa.  There are no palpable masses.,A:,  Although unlikely based on the patient's exam and pain, I have to consider subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease.  GC and chlamydia was sent and I treated her prophylactically with Rocephin 250 mg and azithromycin 1000 mg.  Repeat biopsies were not performed based on her colposcopy as well as her previous Pap and colposcopy by Dr. A.  A LEEP is a reasonable approach even in this 16-year-old.,P:,  We will schedule LEEP in the near future.  Even though she has already been exposed HPV Gardasil would still be beneficial in this patient to help prevent recurrence of low-grade lesions as well as high-grade lesions.  Now, we have her given her first shot.
PREOP DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left pilon fracture.,2.  Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left pilon fracture.,2.  Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,1.  External fixation of left pilon fracture.,2.  Closed reduction of left great toe, T1 fracture.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,BLOOD LOSS:  ,Less than 10 mL.,Needle, instrument, and sponge counts were done and correct.,DRAINS AND TUBES: , None.,SPECIMENS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 58-year-old female who was involved in an auto versus a tree accident on 6/15/2009.  The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time.  The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness.  She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  All questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,FINDINGS:,1.  There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,PLAN:  ,The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.  She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Cataract, left eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Cataract, left eye.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Extracapsular cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens, left eye.,ANESTHESIA: , Topical.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE: , After the induction of topical anesthesia with 4% Xylocaine drops, the left eye was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A speculum was inserted, and the microscope was moved into position.,A 3.2-mm incision was made in clear cornea at the limbus with a diamond keratome at the 3 o'clock position, and 0.1 cc of 1% Xylocaine without preservative was instilled into the anterior chamber.  It was then filled with viscoelastic.  A stab incision was made into the anterior chamber at the limbus at 5 o'clock position with a microblade.,A cystitome was used to make a capsulotomy, and the capsulorrhexis forceps were used to complete a circular capsulorrhexis.  The nucleus was hydrodelineated and hydrodissected with balanced salt solution on a 26-gauge cannula, and the phacoemulsifier was used to phacoemulsify the nucleus using a bimanual technique with the nucleus rotator inserted through the keratotomy incision.  The irrigation-aspiration handpiece was used to systematically aspirate cortex 360 degrees.  The posterior capsule was vacuumed; it was clear and intact.,The capsular bag and the anterior chamber were filled with viscoelastic.  A model MA30AC lens, power 21.5 diopters, serial number 864414.095, was folded, grasped with the lens insertion forceps and inserted into the capsular bag.  The trailing loop was placed inside the bag.  The viscoelastic was removed with the irrigation-aspiration handpiece.  The lens centered well.  A single 10-0 nylon suture was placed to close the wound.  It was checked and ascertained to be watertight.  Decadron 0.25 cc, 0.25 cc of antibiotic and 0.25 cc of Xylocaine were injected subconjunctivally.  Dexacidin ointment was placed in the eye, and the procedure was terminated.,The procedure was well tolerated by the patient who was returned to the recovery room in good condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 61-year-old woman with a history of polyarteritis nodosa, mononeuritis multiplex involving the lower extremities, and severe sleep apnea returns in followup following an overnight sleep study, on CPAP and oxygen to evaluate her for difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep.  She returns today to review results of an inpatient study performed approximately two weeks ago.,In the meantime, the patient reports she continues on substantial doses of opiate medication to control leg pain from mononeuritis multiplex.,She also takes Lasix for lower extremity edema.,The patient reports that she generally initiates sleep on CPAP, but rips her mask off, tosses and turns throughout the night and has "terrible quality sleep.",MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are as previously noted.  Changes include reduction in prednisone from 9 to 6 mg by mouth every morning.  She continues to take Ativan 1 mg every six hours as needed.  She takes imipramine 425 mg at bedtime.,Her MS Contin dose is 150 mg every 8 to 12 hours and an immediate release morphine preparation, 45 to 75 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.,FINDINGS: , Vital signs:  Blood pressure 153/81, pulse 90, respiratory rate 20, weight 311.8 pounds (up 10 pounds from earlier this month), height 5 feet 6 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees, SaO2 is 88% on room air at rest.  Chest is clear.  Extremities show lower extremity pretibial edema with erythema.,LABORATORIES: , An arterial blood gas on room air showed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 52, and PO2 of 57.,CPAP compliance monitoring over the past two to three weeks showed average use of 3 hours 26 minutes on nights used.  She used it for greater than 4 hours per night on 67% of night surveyed.  Her estimated apnea/hypopnea index was 3 per hour.  Her average leak flow was 67 liters per minute.,The patient's overnight sleep study was performed as an inpatient sleep study during a routine hospitalization for intravenous gamma globulin therapy.  She slept for a total sleep time of 257 minutes out of 272 minutes in bed (sleep efficiency approximately 90%).  Sleep stage distribution was relatively normal with 2% stage I, 72% stage II, 24% stage III, IV, and 2% stage REM sleep.,There were no periodic limb movements during sleep.,There was evidence of a severe predominantly central sleep apnea during non-REM sleep at 173 episodes per hour and during REM sleep at 77 episodes per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturations during non-REM sleep fluctuated from the baseline of 92% to an average low of 82%.  During REM sleep, the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation was 87% , decreased to 81% with sleep-disordered breathing episodes.,Of note, the sleep study was performed on CPAP at 10.5 cm of H2O with oxygen at 8 liters per minute.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  The patient has evidence of a well-compensated respiratory acidosis, which is probably primarily related to severe obesity.  In addition, there may be contribution from large doses of opiates and standing doses of gabapentin.,2.  Severe central sleep apnea, on CPAP at 10 cmH2O and supplemental oxygen at 8 liters per minute.  The breathing pattern is that of cluster or Biot's breathing throughout sleep.  The primary etiology is probably opiate use, with contribution with further exacerbation by severe obesity which acts to lower the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation, and worsen desaturations during apneic episodes.,3.  Mononeuritis multiplex with pain requiring significant substantial doses of analgesia.,4.  Hypoxemia primarily due to obesity, hypoventilation, and presumably basilar atelectasis and a combination of V/Q mismatch and shunt on that basis.,PLANS: , My overall impression is that we should treat this patient's sleep disruption with measures to decrease central sleep apnea during sleep.  These will include, (1).  Decrease in evening doses of MS Contin, (2).  Modest weight loss of approximately 10 to 20 pounds, and (3).  Instituting Automated Servo Ventilation via nasal mask.  With regard to latter, the patient will be returning for a trial of ASV to examine its effect on sleep-disordered breathing patterns.,In addition, the patient will benefit from modest diuresis, with improvement of oxygenation, as well as nocturnal desaturation and oxygen requirements.  I have encouraged the patient to increase her dose of Lasix from 100 to 120 mg by mouth every morning as previously prescribed.  I have also asked her to add Lasix in additional late afternoon to evening dose of Lasix at 40 mg by mouth at that time.  She was instructed to take between one and two K-Tab with her evening dose of Lasix (10 to 20 mEq).,In addition, we will obtain a complete set of pulmonary function studies to evaluate this patient for underlying causes of parenchymal lung disease that may interfere with oxygenation.  Further workup for hypoxemia may include high-resolution CT scanning if evidence for significant pulmonary restriction and/or reductions in diffusion capacity is evident on pulmonary function testing.
EXAM:,  CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO Contrast, ,REASON FOR EXAM: , Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. , ,TECHNIQUE: , 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement.  No oral or rectal contrast was utilized.  Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05.  There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP.  Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips.  The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen.  There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak.  Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either.  No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level.  There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present.  The findings are unchanged from the prior exam.  ,The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present.  There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney.  No hydronephrosis is present.  No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. ,The lung bases are clear. ,Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified.  There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement.  There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  The bladder grossly appears normal.  A hysterectomy has been performed.  ,IMPRESSION:,1.  No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described.  The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04.  ,2.  Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level.  ,3.  No other acute findings noted. ,4.  Advanced left renal atrophy.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right wrist laceration with a flexor carpi radialis laceration and palmaris longus laceration 90%, suspected radial artery laceration.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right wrist laceration with a flexor carpi radialis laceration and palmaris longus laceration 90%, suspected radial artery laceration.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  ,1.  Repair flexor carpi radialis.,2.  Repair palmaris longus.,ANESTHETIC: , General.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,Less than 30 minutes.,CLINICAL NOTE:  ,The patient is a 21-year-old who sustained a clean laceration off a teapot last night.  She had lacerated her flexor carpi radialis completely and 90% of her palmaris longus.  Both were repaired proximal to the carpal tunnel.  The postoperative plans are for a dorsal splint and early range of motion passive and active assist.  The wrist will be at approximately 30 degrees of flexion.  The MPJ is at 30 degrees of flexion, the IP straight.  Splinting will be used until the 4-week postoperative point.,PROCEDURE: , Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  There were 2 transverse lacerations.  Through the first laceration, the flexor carpi radialis was completely severed.  The proximal end was found with a tendon retriever.  The distal end was just beneath the subcutaneous tissue.,A primary core stitch was used with a Kessler stitch.  This was with 4-0 FiberWire.  A second core stitch was placed, again using 4-0 FiberWire.  The repair was oversewn with locking, running, 6-0 Prolene stitch.  Through the second incision, the palmaris longus was seen to be approximately 90% severed.  It was an oblique laceration.  It was repaired with a 4-0 FiberWire core stitch and with a Kessler-type stitch.  A secure repair was obtained.  She was dorsiflexed to 75 degrees of wrist extension without rupture of the repair.  The fascia was released proximally and distally to give her more room for excursion of the repair.,The tourniquet was dropped, bleeders were cauterized.  Closure was routine with interrupted 5-0 nylon.  A bulky hand dressing as well as a dorsal splint with the wrist MPJ and IP as noted.  The splint was dorsal.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left carpal tunnel syndrome.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Left carpal tunnel release.,FINDINGS:,  Showed severe compression of the median nerve on the left at the wrist.,SPECIMENS:  ,None.,FLUIDS:,  500 mL of crystalloids.,URINE OUTPUT:,  No Foley catheter.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ANESTHESIA: , General through a laryngeal mask.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,CONDITION: , Resuscitated with stable vital signs.,INDICATION FOR THE OPERATION: , This is a case of a very pleasant 65-year-old forensic pathologist who I previously had performed initially a discectomy and removal of infection at 6-7, followed by anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C5-6 and C6-7 with spinal instrumentation.  At the time of initial consultation, the patient was also found to have bilateral carpal tunnel and for which we are addressing the left side now.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him for most of the risk would be that of infection because of the patient's diabetes and a previous history of infection in the form of pneumonia.  There is also the possibility of bleeding as well as the possibility of injury to the median nerve on dissection.  He understood this risk and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction of anesthesia and placement of a laryngeal mask, he remained supine on the operating table.  The left upper extremity was then prepped with Betadine soap and antiseptic solution.  After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made following inflation of blood pressure cuff to 250 mmHg.  Clamp time approximately 30 minutes.  An incision was then made right in the mid palm area between the thenar and hypothenar eminence.  Meticulous hemostasis of any bleeders were done.  The fat was identified.  The palmar aponeurosis was identified and cut and this was traced down to the wrist.  There was severe compression of the median nerve.  Additional removal of the aponeurosis was performed to allow for further decompression.  After this was all completed, the area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin solution and closed as a single layer using Prolene 4-0 as interrupted vertical mattress stitches.  Dressing was applied.  The patient was brought to the recovery.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,  Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,  Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: , Postoperative ileus.,PROCEDURES DONE: , Hiatal hernia repair and Nissen fundoplication revision.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is an 18-year-old male who has had a history of a Nissen fundoplication performed six years ago for gastric reflux.  Approximately one year ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and CT scan at that time showed that he had a hiatal hernia.  Over the past year, this has caused him an increasing number of problems, including chest pain when he eats, and shortness of breath after large meals.  He is also having reflux symptoms again.  He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure.  He was stable at that time.  He did complain of some nausea.  However, he did not have any vomiting at that time.  He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o.  He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol.  On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed.  Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows.  He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting.  Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications.  He ambulated frequently.  He remained n.p.o. for three days.  He also had the NG tube in during that time.  On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued.  He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications.  At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control.  However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively.  After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA.  The PCA was discontinued.  He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently.  On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications.  His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications.  He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues.,DISCHARGE CONDITION:,  Stable.,DISPOSITION: , Discharged to home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet.  It was also recommended that he does not drink any soda postoperatively.  He is instructed to keep his incision site clean and dry and it was also recommended that he avoid any heavy lifting.  He will be able to attend school when it starts in a few weeks.  However, he is not going to be able to play football in the near future.  He was given prescription for pain medication upon discharge.  He is instructed to contact Pediatric Surgery if he has any fevers, any nausea and vomiting, any chest pain, any constipation, or any other concerns.

PROCEDURE:, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:, Iron-deficiency anemia.,MEDICATIONS:, MAC.,The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, and aspiration.,PROCEDURE:, After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the upper endoscope was inserted into the oropharynx down into the stomach and beyond the pylorus and the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal mucosa was completely normal. The pylorus was normal. In the stomach, there was evidence of diffuse atrophic-appearing nodular gastritis. Multiple biopsies were obtained. There also was a 1.5-cm adenomatous appearing polyp along the greater curvature at the junction of the body and antrum. There was mild ulceration on the tip of this polyp. It was decided to remove the polyp via snare polypectomy. Retroflexion was performed, and this revealed a small hiatal hernia in the distal esophagus. The Z-line was identified and was unremarkable. The esophageal mucosa was normal.,FINDINGS:,1. Hiatal hernia.,2. Diffuse nodular and atrophic appearing gastritis, biopsies taken.,3. A 1.5-cm polyp with ulceration along the greater curvature, removed.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. Follow up biopsies.,2. Continue PPI.,3. Hold Lovenox for 5 days.,4. Place SCDs.
SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient returns to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic for followup evaluation of interstitial disease secondary to lupus pneumonitis.  She was last seen in the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic in January 2004.  Since that time, her respiratory status has been quite good.  She has had no major respiratory difficulties; however, starting yesterday she began with increasing back and joint pain and as a result a deep breath has caused some back discomfort.  She denies any problems with cough or sputum production.  No fevers or chills.  Recently, she has had a bit more problems with fatigue.  For the most part, she has had no pulmonary limitations to her activity.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Synthroid 0.112 mg daily; Prilosec 20 mg daily; prednisone, she was 2.5 mg daily, but discontinued this on 06/16/2004; Plaquenil 200 mg b.i.d.; Imuran 100 mg daily; Advair one puff b.i.d.; Premarin 0.3 mg daily; Lipitor 10 mg Monday through Friday; Actonel 35 mg weekly; and aspirin 81 mg daily.  She is also on calcium, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C and a multivitamin.,ALLERGIES:,  Penicillin and also intolerance to shellfish.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Noncontributory except as outlined above.,EXAMINATION:,General:  The patient was in no acute distress.,Vital signs:  Blood pressure 122/60, pulse 72 and respiratory rate 16.,HEENT:  Nasal mucosa was mild-to-moderately erythematous and edematous.  Oropharynx was clear.,Neck:  Supple without palpable lymphadenopathy.,Chest:  Chest demonstrates decreased breath sounds, but clear.,Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.,Extremities:  Without edema.  No skin lesions.,O2 saturation was checked at rest.  On room air it was 96% and on ambulation it varied between 94% and 96%.  Chest x-ray obtained today showed mild increased interstitial markings consistent with a history of lupus pneumonitis.  She has not had the previous chest x-ray with which to compare; however, I did compare the markings was less prominent when compared with previous CT scan.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Lupus with mild pneumonitis.,2.  Respiratory status is stable.,3.  Increasing back and joint pain, possibly related to patients lupus, however, in fact may be related to recent discontinuation of prednisone.,PLAN:,  At this time, I have recommended to continue her current medications.  We would like to see her back in approximately four to five months, at which time I would like to recheck her pulmonary function test as well as check CAT scan.  At that point, it may be reasonable to consider weaning her Imuran if her pulmonary status is stable and the lupus appears to be under control.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Enlarged fibroid uterus.,2.  Blood loss anemia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Enlarged fibroid uterus.,2.  Blood loss anemia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Laparotomy.,2.  Myomectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than a 100 cc.,URINE OUTPUT: , 110 cc, clear at the end of the procedure.,FLUIDS: , 500 cc during the procedure.,SPECIMENS: , Four uterine fibroids.,DRAINS:  ,Foley catheter to gravity.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the patient has an enlarged, approximately 14-week sized uterus that is freely mobile and anteverted with no adnexal masses.  Surgically, the patient has an enlarged fibroid uterus with a large fundal/anterior fibroids, which is approximately 6+ cm and several small submucosal fibroids within the endometrium.  Both ovaries and tubes appeared within normal limits.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where she was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position.  After the general anesthetic was found to be adequate, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife.  This was carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with the second knife and the fascial incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying layer of rectus muscle bluntly.  It was then dissected in the middle with the Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified with hemostat clamps, tented up, and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors and then extended bluntly.  Next, the uterus was grasped bluntly and removed from the abdomen.  The fundal fibroid was identified.  It was then injected with vasopressin, 20 units mixed in 30 cc of normal saline along the serosal surface and careful to aspirate to avoid any blood vessels.  15 cc was injected.  Next, the point tip was used with the cautery _______ cutting to cut the linear incision along the top of the _______ fibroid until fibroid fibers were seen.  The edges of the myometrium was grasped with Allis clamps, tented up, and a hemostat was used to bluntly dissect around the fibroid followed by blunt dissection with a finger.  The fibroid was easily and bluntly dissected out.  It was also grasped with Lahey clamp to prevent traction.  Once the blunt dissection of the large fibroid was complete, it was handed off to the scrub nurse.  The large fibroid traversed the whole myometrium down to the mucosal surface and the endometrial cavity was largely entered when this fibroid was removed.  At this point, several smaller fibroids were noticed along the endometrial surface of the uterus.  Three of these were removed just by bluntly grasping with the Lahey clamp and twisting, all three of these were approximately 1 cm to 2 cm in size.  These were also handed to the scrub tech.  Next, the uterine incision was then closed with first two interrupted layers of #0 chromic in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion and then with a #0 Vicryl in a running baseball stitch.  The uterus was seen to be completely hemostatic after closure.  Next, a 3 x 4 inch piece of Interceed was placed over the incision and dampened with normal saline.  The uterus was then carefully returned to the abdomen and being careful not to disturb the Interceed.  Next, the greater omentum was replaced over the uterus.,The rectus muscles were then reapproximated with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl in the midline.  Then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Next, the Scarpa's fascia was closed with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The incision was then dressed with 0.5-inch Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately.  After the patient was cleaned, she was taken to Recovery in stable condition and she will be followed for her immediate postoperative period during the hospital.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,The patient does not have any chief complaint.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 93-year-old female who called up her next-door neighbor to say that she was not feeling well.  The next-door neighbor came over and decided that she should go to the emergency room to be check out for her generalized complaint of not feeling well.  The neighbor suspects that this may have been due to the patient taking too many of her Tylenol PM, which the patient has been known to do.  The patient was a little somnolent early this morning and was found only to be oriented x1 with EMS upon their arrival to the patient's house.  The patient states that she just simply felt funny and does not give any more specific details than this.  The patient denies any pain at any time.  She did not have any shortness of breath.  No nausea or vomiting.  No generalized weakness.  The patient states that all that has gone away since arrival here in the hospital, that she feels at her usual self, is not sure why she is here in the hospital, and thinks she should go.  The patient's primary care physician, Dr. X reports that the patient spoke with him yesterday and had complained of shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, as well as generalized weakness, but the patient states that all this has resolved.

EXAM:  ,Ultrasound left lower extremity, duplex venous,REASON FOR EXAM: , Swelling and rule out DVT.,FINDINGS: , Duplex and color Doppler interrogation of the left lower extremity deep venous system was performed. Compressibility, augmentation, and color flow as well as Doppler flow was demonstrated within the common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal vein. The posterior tibial vein also demonstrated flow along its proximal visualized extent.,IMPRESSION: , No evidence of left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Tracheal stenosis and metal stent complications.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Tracheal stenosis and metal stent complications.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS:,1.  Normal true vocal cords.,2.  Subglottic stenosis down to 5 mm with mature cicatrix.,3.  Tracheal granulation tissue growing through the stents at the midway point of the stents.,5.  Three metallic stents in place in the proximal trachea.,6.  Distance from the true vocal cords to the proximal stent, 2 cm.,7.  Distance from the proximal stent to the distal stent, 3.5 cm.,8.  Distance from the distal stent to the carina, 8 cm.,9.  Distal airway is clear.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Rigid bronchoscopy with dilation.,2.  Excision of granulation tissue tumor.,3.  Application of mitomycin-C.,4.  Endobronchial ultrasound.,TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained from the patient and her husband, she was brought to the operating theater after sequence induction was done.  She had a Dedo laryngoscope placed.  Her airways were inspected thoroughly with findings as described above.  She was intermittently ventilated with an endotracheal tube placed through the Dedo scope.  Her granulation tissue was biopsied and then removed with a microdebrider.  Her proximal trachea was dilated with a combination of balloon, Bougie, and rigid scopes.  She tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, and brought to the PACU.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left renal mass, 5 cm in diameter.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left renal mass, 5 cm in diameter.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Left partial nephrectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General with epidural.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , About 350 mL.,REPLACEMENT: , Crystalloid and Cell Savers from the case.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  ,This is a 64-year-old man with a left renal mass that was confirmed to be renal cell carcinoma by needle biopsy.  Due to the peripheral nature of the tumor located in the mid to lower pole laterally, he has elected to undergo a partial nephrectomy.  Potential complications include but are not limited to,,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Postoperative pain.,4.  Herniation from the incision.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Epidural anesthesia was administered in the holding area, after which the patient was transferred into the operating room.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, after which the patient was positioned in the flank standard position.  A left flank incision was made over the area of the twelfth rib.  The subcutaneous space was opened by using the Bovie.  The ribs were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space between the eleventh and twelfth rib was opened by using the Bovie.  The fascial layer covering of the intercostal space was opened completely until the retroperitoneum was entered.  Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision was extended until the peritoneal envelope could be identified.  The peritoneum was swept medially.  The Finochietto retractor was then placed for exposure.  The kidney was readily identified and was mobilized from outside Gerota's fascia.  The ureter was dissected out easily and was separated with a vessel loop.  The superior aspect of the kidney was mobilized from the superior attachment.  The pedicle of the left kidney was completely dissected revealing the vein and the artery.  The artery was a single artery and was dissected easily by using a right-angle clamp.  A vessel loop was placed around the renal artery.  The tumor could be easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney.  The Gerota's fascia overlying that portion of the kidney was opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.  Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule was scored using a Bovie about 0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor.  Bulldog clamp was then placed on the renal artery.  The tumor was then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal renal cortex.  This was performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel.  The tumor was removed easily.  The argon beam coagulation device was then utilized to coagulate the base of the resection.  The visible larger bleeding vessels were oversewn by using 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The edges of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl suture with pledgets at the ends of the sutures to prevent the sutures from pulling through.  Two horizontal mattress sutures were placed and were tied down.  The Gerota's fascia was then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The area of the kidney at the base was covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures.  The bulldog clamp was removed and perfect hemostasis was evident.  There was no evidence of violation into the calyceal system.  A 19-French Blake drain was placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting the left flank inferior to the incision.  The drain was anchored by using silk sutures.  The flank fascial layers were closed in three separate layers in the more medial aspect.  The lateral posterior aspect was closed in two separate layers using Vicryl sutures.  The skin was finally reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Posttraumatic nasal deformity.,2.  Nasal obstruction.,3.  Nasal valve collapse.,4.  Request for cosmetic change with excellent appearance of nose.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Posttraumatic nasal deformity.,2.  Nasal obstruction.,3.  Nasal valve collapse.,4.  Request for cosmetic change with excellent appearance of nose.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURES:,1.  Left ear cartilage graft.,2.  Repair of nasal vestibular stenosis using an ear cartilage graft.,3.  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.,4.  Left inferior turbinectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is with symptomatic nasal obstruction and fixed nasal valve collapse following a previous nasal fracture and attempted repair.  We discussed with the patient the indications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the proposed surgical procedure, she had her questions asked and answered.  Preoperative imaging was performed in consultation with regard to aesthetic results and communicated via the computerized imager.  The patient had questions asked and answered.  Informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was converted to the lounge chair position, and the nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with an inverted going incision and elevation of the skin of the nose in the submucoperichondrial plane over the medial crural footplates and lower lateral cartilages and up over the dorsum.  The septal angle was approached and submucoperichondrial flaps were elevated.  Severe nasal septal deviation to the right hand side and evidence of an old fracture with a separate alignment of the cartilaginous nose from the bony nose was encountered.  The upper laterals were divided and medial and lateral osteotomies were carried out.  Inadequate septal cartilage was noted to be present for use as spreader graft; therefore, left postauricular incision was made, and the conchal bowl cartilage graft was harvested, and it was closed with 3-0 running locking chromic with a sterile cotton ball pressure dressing applied.  Ear cartilage graft was then placed to put two spreader grafts on the left and one the right.  The two on the left extended all the way up to the caudal tip, the one on the right just primarily the medial wall.  It was placed in such a way to correct a caudal dorsal deviation of the nasal tip septum.  The upper lateral cartilage was noted to be of the same width and length in size.  Yet, the left lower cartilage was scarred and adherent to the upper lateral cartilage.  The upper lateral cartilages were noted to be excessive of uneven length with the right being much taller than the left and that was shortened to the same length.  The scar bands were released in the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages to allow free mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages.  A middle crus stitch was used to unite the domes, and then the nose was projected by suturing the medial crural footplates of the caudal septum in deep projected fashion.  Crushed ear cartilage was then placed in the pockets above the spreader grafts in the area of the deficient dorsal nasal height and the lateral nasal sidewall height.  The spreader brought an excellent aesthetic appearance to the nose.  We left more than 1 cm of dorsal and caudal support for the nasal tip and dorsum height.  Mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with 5-0 chromic and 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed on each side of nasal septum and secured with 3-0 nylon and a Denver splint was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hypermenorrhea.,2.  Pelvic pain.,3.  Infertility.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Enlarged fibroid uterus.,2.  Infertility.,3.  Pelvic pain.,4.  Probable bilateral tubal occlusion.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Dilatation and curettage.,2.  Laparoscopy.,3.  Injection of indigo carmine dye.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The uterus was anteverted, firm, enlarged, irregular, and mobile.  The cervix is nulliparous without lesions.  Adnexal examination was negative for masses.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed in the lithotomy position, properly prepared and draped in sterile manner.  After bimanual examination, the cervix was exposed with a weighted vaginal speculum and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  Uterus sounded to a depth of 10.5 cm.  Endocervical canal was progressively dilated with Hanks dilators to #20-French.  A medium-sized sharp curet was used to obtain a moderated amount of tissue upon curettage, which was taken from all uterine quadrants and sent to the pathologist for analysis.  A ________ syringe was then introduced into the uterine cavity to a depth of 9 cm and the balloon insufflated with 10 cc of air.  A 20 cc syringe filled with dilute indigo carmine dye was attached to the end of the ________ syringe to use to inject at the time of laparoscopy.,A small subumbilical incision was then made with insertion of the step dilating sheath with a Veress needle into the peritoneal cavity.  The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with 3 liters of carbondioxide and a 12 mm trocar inserted.  The laparoscope was then inserted through the trocar with visualization of the pelvic contents.  In steep Trendelenburg position, the uterus was visualized and aided by use of a Bierman needle to displace bowel from visualized areas.  The fallopian tubes appeared normal bilaterally with good visualization of a normal appearing fimbria.  The ovaries also appeared normal bilaterally.  The uterus was greatly enlarged and distorted with large fibroids in multiple areas and especially on the right coronal area.  An attempt was made to inject the indigo carmine dye and in fact a three syringes of 20 cc were injected without any visualization of intraperitoneal dye still.  Both fallopian tubes apparently were blocked.  The upper abdomen was visually explored and found to be normal as was the bowel and area of the right ileum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Instruments were removed from the vaginal vault and the abdomen.  Trocar was removed and the carbondioxide allowed to escape and the subumbilical wound repaired with two #4-0 undyed Vicryl sutures.  Sterile dressing was applied to the wound and the patient was sent to the recovery area in satisfactory postoperative condition.
PRESENTATION: , Patient, 13 years old, comes to your office with his mother complaining about severe ear pain.  He awoke during the night with severe ear pain, and mom states that this is the third time this year he has had earaches.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Patient reports that he felt good after taking antibiotics with each earache episode and has recently started on the wrestling team.  Mom reports that patient has been afebrile with each of the earache episodes, and he has not had upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient denies any head trauma associated with wrestling practice.,BIRTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:,  Patient's mother reports a normal pregnancy with no complications, having received prenatal care from 12 weeks.  Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.,FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.,NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: , Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.  He takes his lunch (usually a sandwich and chips or yogurt and fruit) for lunch.  Mom or his sister cooks supper in the evening.  The family goes out to eat once or twice a week and he only gets "fast food" once or twice a week according to his Mom.  He says he eats "a lot" especially after a wrestling meet.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,Height/weight:  Patient weighs 109 pounds (60th percentile) and is 69 inches tall (93rd percentile).  He is following the growth pattern he established in infancy.,Vital signs:  BP 110/60, T 99.2, HR 70, R 16.,General:  Alert, cooperative but a bit shy.,Neuro:  DTRs symmetric, 2+, negative Romberg, able to perform simple calculations without difficulty, short-term memory intact.  He responds appropriately to verbal and visual cues, and movements are smooth and coordinated.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, PEERLA, red reflex present, optic disk and ocular vessels normal.  TMs deep red, dull, landmarks obscured, full bilaterally.  Post auricular and submandibular nodes on left are palpable and slightly tender.,Lungs:  CTA, breath sounds equal bilaterally, excursion and chest configuration normal.,Cardiac:  S1, S2 split, no murmurs, pulses equal bilaterally.,Abdomen:  Soft, rounded, reports no epigastric tenderness but states that heartburn begins in epigastric area and rises to throat.  Bowel sounds active in all quadrants.  No hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.  No CVA tenderness.,Musculoskeletal:  Full range of motion, all extremities.  Spine straight, able to perform jumping jacks and duck walk without difficulty.,Genital:  Normal male, Tanner stage 4.  Rectal exam - small amount of soft stool, no fissures or masses.,LABS:  ,Stool negative for blood and H. pylori antigen.  Normal CBC and urinalysis.  A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.,ASSESSMENT: , The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.,CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. , Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of "heartburn" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled.
Sample Address,RE:  Sample Patient,Wife's name:  Sample Name,Dear Sample Doctor:,Mr. Sample Patient was seen on Month DD, YYYY, describing a vasectomy 10 years ago and a failed vasectomy reversal done almost two years ago at the University of Michigan.  He has remained azoospermic postoperatively.  The operative note suggests the presence of some sperm and sperm head on the right side at the time of the vasectomy reversal.,He states that he is interested in sperm harvesting and cryopreservation prior to the next attempted ovulation induction for his wife.  Apparently, several attempts at induction have been tried and due to some anatomic abnormality, they have been unsuccessful.,At the time that he left the office, he was asking for cryopreservation.  At the time of sperm harvesting, I recently received a phone call suggesting that he does not want to do this at all unless his wife's ovulation has been confirmed and it appears then that he may be interested in a fresh specimen harvest.  I look forward to hearing from you regarding the actual plan so that we can arrange our procedure appropriately.  At his initial request, Month DD, YYYY was picked as the date for scheduled harvesting, although this may change if you require fresh specimen.,Thank you very much for the opportunity to have seen him.,Sample Doctor, M.D.
EXAM: , Carotid and cerebral arteriograms.,INDICATION: , Abnormal carotid duplex studies demonstrating occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery approximately 3 cm distal to its origin.,2.  Mild stenosis of the right internal carotid artery measured at 20%.,3.  Patent bilateral vertebral arteries.,4.  No significant disease was identified of the anterior cerebral vessels.,DISCUSSION:  ,Carotid and cerebral arteriograms were performed on Month DD, YYYY, previous studies are not available for comparison.,The right groin was sterilely cleansed and draped.  Lidocaine 1% buffered with sodium bicarbonate was used as local anesthetic.  A 19-French needle was then advanced into the common femoral artery and a wire was advanced.  Over the wire, a sheath was placed.  A wire was then advanced into the abdominal aorta and over the wire and the flushed catheter was then advanced to the arch of the aorta over a wire.  Flushed arteriogram was performed.  Arteriogram demonstrated no significant disease of the great vessels at their origins.  There is demonstration of complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery approximately 3 cm distal to its origin.  The vertebral arteries were widely patent.  Following this, the flushed catheter was exchanged for ***** catheter and selective catheterization of the common carotid artery on the right was performed.  Carotid and cerebral arteriograms were performed.  The carotid arteriograms on the right demonstrated the carotid bulb to be unremarkable.  The external carotid artery on the right is quite tortuous in its appearance.  The internal carotid artery demonstrates a mild plaque creating stenosis, which is measured approximately 20%.  Cerebral arteriogram on the right demonstrated the A1 and M1 segments bilaterally to be normal.  No significant stenosis identified.  There is complete cross-filling into the left brain via the right.  No significant stenosis was appreciated.,Following this, the catheter was parked at the origin of the left common carotid artery and ejection demonstrated complete occlusion.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications occurred during or immediately after the procedure.  Stasis was achieved of the puncture site using a VasoSeal.  The patient will be observed for at least 2-1/2 hours prior to being discharged to home.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Obstructive sleep apnea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Obstructive sleep apnea.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Tonsillectomy.,2.  Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 50 cc.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a history of obstructive sleep apnea who has been using CPAP, however, he was not tolerating used of the machine and requested a surgical procedure for correction of his apnea.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the operative suite where he was placed in supine position and general endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away and a shoulder roll was placed and a McIvor mouthgag was inserted into the oral cavity.  Correct inspection and palpation did not reveal evidence of a bifid uvula or submucosal clots.  Attention was directed first to the right tonsil in which a curved Allis forceps was applied to the superior pole.  The needle-tip Bovie cautery was used to incise the mucosa of the anterior tonsillar pillar.  Once the tonsillar pillar was identified and the superior pole was released, the curved forceps with a straight Allis forceps and the dissection was carried down inferiorly, dissecting the tonsil free from all fascial attachments.  Once the tonsil was delivered from the oral cavity, hemostasis was obtained within the tonsillar fossa utilizing suction cautery.,Attention was then directed over to the left tonsil in which a similar procedure was performed.  Once all bleeding was controlled, the mucosa of both the hard and soft palate was anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:50000 epinephrine solution.  Now attention was directed to the posterior pillars.  A hemostat was used to clamp the posterior pillar, which was then taken down with Metzenbaum scissors.  The posterior pillar was then approximated to the anterior pillar with the use of #3-0 PDS suture so as to create a box shaped soft palate.  Now, the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and #12 blade scalpel was used to incise the mucosa of the soft palate extending down onto the uvula.  The mucosa was dissected off with the use of Potts scissors.  Now the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and sutured down in place with use of #3-0 PDS suture approximated with deep muscle layers.  Now the mucosa of the soft palate and the uvula were approximated with interrupted #3-0 PDS sutures.  Finally, #4-0 Vicryl sutures were placed intermittently between the PDS to further secure the uvula, which had been reflected onto the soft palate.  A final #3-0 PDS suture was used to further approximate the anterior and posterior tonsil pillars.  Final inspection did not reveal any further bleeding.  The mouth was then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  He was awakened and taken to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted as an observation patient to the Telemetry Floor for routine postoperative management.  Of note, IV Decadron was administered during the procedure.
S - ,An 83-year-old diabetic female presents today stating that she would like diabetic foot care.,O - ,On examination, the lateral aspect of her left great toenail is deeply ingrown.  Her toenails are thick and opaque.  Vibratory sensation appears to be intact.  Dorsal pedal pulses are 1/4.  There is no hair growth seen on her toes, feet or lower legs.  Her feet are warm to the touch.  All of her toenails are hypertrophic, opaque, elongated and discolored.,A - ,1.  Onychocryptosis.,
CLINICAL HISTORY: , This is a 16-year-old man evaluated for sleep difficulties.  He states he is "feeling bad in the mornings" that he has daytime somnolence and "whenever I wake up I experience dizziness, weakness, stomachache, loss of appetite, drowsiness, overall sore body and a general feeling of unwell."  He does state that he has only rarely he got anything suggestive of restless leg syndrome, is unaware of any apnea or like symptoms.  He has a mouth breather.  He states he wakens up during the night, usually goes to bed at 10 to 11, gets up at 7 to 7:30.  In the weekends, he stays up late and sleeps until 1 in the afternoon.  He lists sporadic use of melatonin and Benadryl, and Tylenol PM for sleep.  His other medicines are Accutane, Nasonex and oxymetazoline.  There is no smoking, no alcohol intake.  He does have three caffeinated beverages a week.  He is 75 inches, 185 pounds, BMI 23.1.  He rated himself 4/7 on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale at the onset of the study and 6 on the Epworth Sleeping Scale, said that his night sleep in the lab was characterized by a longer than usual sleep onset latency with more arousals than usual.  He woke up feeling equally rested and the only comment he made on the post sleep questionnaire was "some of the wires" is the source of problems.,TECHNIQUE: , The study was performed with the following parameters measured throughout the entirety of the recording:,Electroencephalogram, electromyogram of the chin and lower extremities, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram, air flow from the nose and mouth, respiratory effort at the chest and abdomen, and finger oximetry.,The record was scored for sleep and the various other parameters in 30-second epochs.,RESULTS: , This study was performed in 61 minutes in duration during which he slept 432 minutes after 19 minutes sleep onset latency; thereafter, he had 10 awakenings for 6 minutes of wakefulness giving him a normal sleep efficiency of 95%.  Sleep staging was actually fairly deep and normal for age with 5% stage I, 51% stage II, 22% slow wave sleep and 22% REM.  He had 5 REM periods during the night.  The first beginning 66 minutes after sleep onset.  He did have 63 arousals, giving him a borderline elevated arousal index of 8.8, 16 were driven by limb movements, 41 of unclear origin, 6 from hypopneas.,EEG PARAMETERS: , No abnormalities.,EKG PARAMETERS: , Normal sinus rhythm, mean rate 76, no ectopics noted.,EMG PARAMETERS: , 88 PLMs were noted.  There was fairly small excursion with a movement index of 12, only 16 led to arousals with a movement arousal index of 2.2, not considered as a significant feature for sleep fragmentation.,RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS:,  Breathing rate in the high teens, reaching as high as 20 in REM.  There was really no snoring noted.  He slept in all positions and during the night had 9 respiratory events, one was a postarousal central event, the other eight were obstructive hypopneas mean duration 26 seconds, little worse in the supine position where his AHI was 4.7, but overall his AHI was 1.3.  This is only a marginal abnormality and is well below the threshold for CPAP intervention.,IMPRESSION:,  Largely normal polysomnogram demonstrating very modest obstructive sleep apnea in the supine position and a very modest periodic limb movement disturbance.
REASON FOR EVALUATION:,
SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.,ALLERGIES: , Sulfa.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  As I have given are Levaquin, Prinivil 20 mg a day, Bumex 0.5 mg a day, Levsinex 0.375 mg a day, cimetidine 400 mg a day, potassium chloride 8 mEq a day, and atenolol 25 mg a day.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She says she is voiding okay.  She denies fever, chills, or sweats.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  She was able to get up on the table by herself although she is quite unstable.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure was okay at about 120/70 by me.,Neck:  Supple.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft.,Extremities:  There is no edema.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Hypertension controlled.,2.  Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy and stent placed in the left ureter by Dr. F.,3.  Urinary incontinence.,4.  Recent sepsis.,PLAN:,1.  I discussed at length with she and her husband again the need to get into at least an assisted living apartment.,2.  I gave her instructions, in writing, to stop by Dr. Fs office on the way out today to get an appointment for followup regarding her stent.,3.  See me back here in two months.,4.  I made no changes in her medications.

Allograft using Vitoss.,DRAINS: , Round French 10 JP drain.,FLUIDS:  ,1200 cc of crystalloids.,URINE OUTPUT: , No Foley catheter.,SPECIMENS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 50 cc.,INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION:,  This is a case of a very pleasant 38-year-old Caucasian female who has been complaining over the last eight years of neck pain and shoulder pain radiating down across the top of her left shoulder and also across her shoulder blades to the right side, but predominantly down the left upper extremity into the wrist.  The patient has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently, has been treated with pain medications, anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants.  The patient's symptoms continued to persist and subsequently, an MRI of the C-spine was done, which showed disc desiccation, spondylosis and herniated disk at C5-C6, an EMG and CV revealed a presence of mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at C5-C6.  The patient understood the risks and benefits of the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma as this may cause weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  This could also result in dural tear with its attendant symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and posterior neck pain as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  Should the symptoms be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large, she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the CSF leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion, for which she may require redo surgery at this level.  There is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptoms in about 10% of cases.  The patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea as well as the carotid artery.  There is also the risk of stroke, should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled into the right cerebral circulation.  The patient also understands that there could be hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  She understood these risks on top of the risks of anesthesia and gave her consent for the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension and the head supported on a foam doughnut.  A marker was placed.  This verified the level to be at the C5-C6 level and incision was then marked in a transverse fashion starting from the midline extending about 5 mm beyond the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep after the head was turned 45 degrees to the left.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and the platysma was cut using a hot knife in a transverse fashion.  Dissection was then carried underneath the platysma superiorly inferiorly.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried out lateral to the esophagus to trachea as well as medial to the carotid sheath in the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The prevertebral fascia was noted to be taken her case with a lot of fat deposition.  Bipolar coagulation of bleeders was done; however, branch of the superior thyroid artery was ligated with Hemoclips x4.  After this was completed, a localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 level.  We proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of the C5 and C6.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid down.  An anterior osteophyte was carefully drilled using a Midas 5-mm bur and the disk together with the inferior endplate of C5 and the superior endplate of C6 was also drilled down with the Midas 5-mm bur.  This was later followed with a 3-mm bur and the disk together with posterior longitudinal ligament was removed using Kerrison's ranging from 1 to 4 mm.  The herniation was noted on the right.  However, there was significant neuroforaminal stenosis on the left.  Decompression on both sides was done and after this was completed, a Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  The area was then irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A 7 mm implant with its inferior packed with Vitoss was then laid down and secured in place with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws and plate 18 mm, all of which were titanium.  X-ray after this placement showed excellent position of all these implants and screws and _____ and the patient's area was also irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A round French 10 JP drain was then laid down and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The catheter was then anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch and connected to a sterile draining system.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl subcuticular 4-0 Stitch for the dermis, and the wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  Dressing was placed only at the exit site of the catheter.  C-collar was placed.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,1.  Leiomyosarcoma.,2.  History of pulmonary embolism.,3.  History of subdural hematoma.,4.  Pancytopenia.,5.  History of pneumonia.,PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Cycle six of CIVI-CAD (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC) from 07/22/2008 to 07/29/2008.,2.  CTA, chest PE study showing no evidence for pulmonary embolism.,3.  Head CT showing no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.,4.  Sinus CT, normal mini-CT of the paranasal sinuses.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Ms. ABC is a pleasant 66-year-old Caucasian female who first palpated a mass in the left posterior arm in spring of 2007.  The mass increased in size and she was seen by her primary care physician and referred to orthopedic surgeon.  MRI showed inflammation and was thought to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.  The mass increased in size.  She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy.  She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation.  She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,1.  Leiomyosarcoma, the patient was admitted to Hem/Onco B Service under attending Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well.,2.  History of pulmonary embolism.  Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain.  She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day.  She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.,3.  History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own.  Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07/24/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.  The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.,4.  Pancytopenia.  On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400.  The patient's counts were followed throughout admission.  She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07/26/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet.  At discharge her ANC is back up to 1100 and she is taken off neutropenic diet.  Her white blood cell count at discharge was 1.4 and her hemoglobin was 11.2 with a platelet count of 140.,5.  History of pneumonia.  During admission, the patient did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of pneumonia.,DISPOSITION: , Home in stable condition.,DIET: , Regular and less neutropenic.,ACTIVITY: , Resume same activity.,FOLLOWUP:  ,The patient will have lab work at Dr. XYZ on 08/05/2008 and she will also return to the cancer center on 08/12/2008 at 10:20 a.m.  The patient is also advised to monitor for any fevers greater than 100.5 and should she have any further problems in the meantime to please call in to be seen sooner.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Right heart catheterization.,INDICATION: , Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right internal jugular region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right internal jugular vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vessel without resistance.  Small nick was then made in the skin and the needle was removed.  An #8.5 French venous sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted to 20 cm and the balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was advanced into the right atrium through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.  Pulmonary artery saturation was obtained.  The Swan was then kept in place for the patient to be transferred to the ICU for further medical titration.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.,FINDINGS:,  Body surface area equals 2.04, hemoglobin equals 9.3, O2 is at 2 liters nasal cannula.  Pulmonary artery saturation equals 37.8.  Pulse oximetry on 2 liters nasal cannula equals 93%.  Right atrial pressure is 8, right ventricular pressure equals 59/9, pulmonary artery pressure equals 61/31 with mean of 43, pulmonary artery wedge pressure equals 21, cardiac output equals 3.3 by the Fick method, cardiac index is 1.6 by the Fick method, systemic vascular resistance equals 1821, and transpulmonic gradient equals 22.,IMPRESSION:  ,Exam and Swan findings consistent with low perfusion given that the mixed venous O2 is only 38% on current medical therapy as well as elevated right-sided filling pressures and a high systemic vascular resistance.,PLAN: , Given that the patient is unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy secondary to significant orthostasis and the fact that the patient will not respond to oral titration at this point due to lack of cardiac reserve, the patient will need to be discharged home on Primacor.  The patient is unable to continue with his dobutamine therapy secondary to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  At this time, we will transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for titration of the Primacor therapy.  We will also increase his Lasix to 80 mg IV q.d.  We will increase his amiodarone to 400 mg daily.  We will also continue with his Coumadin therapy.  As stated previously, we will discontinue vasodilator therapy starting with the Isordil.

Biopsy was obtained and revealed squamous carcinoma.  The lesion extended slightly above the hymeneal ring and because of vaginal involvement was classified as a T3/Nx/Mx on clinical examination.  Of note, past history is significant for pelvic radiation for cervical cancer many years previously.,FINDINGS: , The examination under anesthesia revealed a 1.5 cm nodule of disease extending slightly above the hymeneal ring.  There was no palpable lymphadenopathy in either inguinal node region.  There were no other nodules, ulcerations, or other lesions.  At the completion of the procedure there was no clinical evidence of residual disease.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  She was placed in the low anterior lithotomy position after adequate anesthesia had been induced.  Examination under anesthesia was performed with findings as noted, after which she was prepped and draped.  The femoral triangles were marked and a 10 cm skin incision was made parallel to the inguinal ligament approximately 3 cm below the ligament.  Camper's fascia was divided and skin flaps were elevated with sharp dissection and ligation of vessels where necessary.  The lymph node bundles were mobilized by incising the loose areolar tissue attachments to the fascia of the rectus abdominis.  The fascia around the sartorius muscle was divided and the specimen was reflected from lateral to medial.  The cribriform fascia was isolated and dissected with preservation of the femoral nerve.  The femoral sheath containing artery and vein was opened and vessels were stripped of their lymphatic attachments.  The medial lymph node bundle was isolated, and Cloquet's node was clamped, divided, and ligated bilaterally.  The saphenous vessels were identified and preserved bilaterally.  The inferior margin of the specimen was ligated, divided, and removed.  Inguinal node sites were irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Jackson-Pratt drains were placed and Camper's fascia was approximated with simple interrupted stitches.  The skin was closed with running subcuticular stitches using 4-0 Monocryl suture.,Attention was turned to the radical vulvectomy specimen.  A marking pen was used to outline the margins of resection allowing 15-20 mm of margin on the inferior, lateral, and anterior margins.  The medial margin extended into the vagina and was approximately 5-8 mm.  The skin was incised and underlying adipose tissue was divided with electrocautery.  Vascular bundles were isolated, divided, and ligated.  After removal of the specimen, additional margin was obtained from the right vaginal side wall adjacent to the tumor site.  Margins were submitted on the right posterior, middle, and anterior vaginal side walls.  After removal of the vaginal margins, the perineum was irrigated with four liters of normal saline and deep tissues were approximated with simple interrupted stitches of 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with interrupted horizontal mattress stitches using 3-0 Vicryl suture.  The final sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.  The patient was then awakened from her anesthetic and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

We have discussed bleeding, infection, injury to the rectum, injury to vessels and nerves, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, MI, stroke, and death.  He had no questions at the conclusion of the conversation and he does know that in his age group, though a nerve-sparing procedure will be performed, preserving any erectile function is highly unlikely.  He had no questions at the conclusion of our last conversation.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Recurrent dysplasia of vulva.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Carbon dioxide laser photo-ablation.,ANESTHESIA: , General, laryngeal mask.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient has a past history of recurrent vulvar dysplasia.  She has had multiple prior procedures for treatment.  She was counseled to undergo laser photo-ablation.,FINDINGS:,  Examination under anesthesia revealed several slightly raised and pigmented lesions, predominantly on the left labia and perianal regions.  After staining with acetic acid, several additional areas of acetowhite epithelium were seen on both sides and in the perianal region.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room with an IV in place.  Anesthetic was administered, after which she was placed in the lithotomy position.  Examination under anesthesia was performed, after which she was prepped and draped.  Acetic acid was applied and marking pen was utilized to outline the extent of the dysplastic lesion.  The carbon dioxide laser was then used to ablate the lesion to the third surgical plane as defined Reid.  Setting was 25 watts using a 6 mm pattern size with the silk-touch hand piece in the paint mode.  Excellent hemostasis was noted and Bacitracin was applied prophylactically.  The patient was awakened from her anesthetic and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.
OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Full mouth dental rehabilitation in the operating room under general anesthesia.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Severe dental caries.,2.  Hemophilia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Severe dental caries.,2.  Hemophilia.,3.  Nonrestorable teeth.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,DURATION OF SURGERY:  ,1 hour and 22 minutes.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient was first seen by me on 08/23/2007, who is 4-year-old with hemophilia, who received infusion on Tuesdays and Thursdays and he has a MediPort.  Mom reported history of high fever after surgery and he has one seizure previously.  He has history of trauma to his front teeth and physician put him on antibiotics.  He was only cooperative for having me do a visual examination on his anterior teeth.  Visual examination revealed severe dental caries and dental abscess from tooth #E and his maxillary anterior teeth needed to be extracted.  Due to his young age and hemophilia, I felt that he would be best served to be taken to the hospital operating room.,OTHER PREPARATION:  ,The child was brought to the Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by his mother.  There, I met with her and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks, and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all her questions and concerns were addressed, she gave her informed consent to proceed with treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  He was given factor for appropriately for his hemophilia prior to being taken back to the operating room.  Once he was cleared by Anesthesia, the child was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with an oral tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and IV was started.  The head and neck were draped with sterile towels and the body was covered with a lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative clinical photographs were taken.  Two posterior bitewing radiographs and two anterior periapical films were taken in the operating room with digital radiograph.  After the radiographs were taken, the lead shield was removed.,Prophylaxis was then performed using a prophy cup and fluoridated prophy paste.  The patient's teeth were rinsed well.  The patient's oral cavity was suctioned clean.  Clinical and radiographic examination followed and areas of decay were noted.  During the restorative phase, these areas of decay were incidentally removed.  Entry was made to the level of the dental-enamel junction and beyond as necessary to remove it.  Final caries removal was confirmed upon reaching hard, firm and sound dentin.,Teeth restored with composite ___________  bonded with a one-step bonding agent.  Teeth restored with amalgam had a dentin tubular seal placed prior to amalgam placement.  Non-restorable primary teeth would be extracted.  The caries were extensive and invaded the pulp tissues, pulp therapy was initiated using ViscoStat and then IRM pulpotomies.  Teeth treated in such a manner would then be crowned with stainless steel crowns.,Upon conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were then taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction with visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.  At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, was taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS: , This young patient presented with mild generalized marginal gingivitis, secondary to light generalized plaque accumulation and fair oral hygiene.  All primary teeth were present.  Dental carries were present on the following teeth:  Tooth B, OL caries, tooth C, M, L, S caries, tooth B, caries on all surfaces, tooth E caries on all surfaces, tooth F caries on all surfaces, tooth T caries on all surfaces, tooth H, lingual and facial caries, tooth I, caries on all surfaces, tooth L caries on all surfaces, and tooth S, all caries.  The remainder of his teeth and soft tissues were within normal limits.  The following restoration and procedures were performed.  Tooth B, OL amalgam, tooth C, M, L, S composite, tooth D, E, F, and G were extracted, tooth H, and L and separate F composite.  Tooth I is stainless steel crown, tooth L pulpotomy and stainless steel crown and tooth S no amalgam.  Sutures were also placed at extraction site D, E, S, and G.,CONCLUSION:  ,The mother was informed of the completion of the procedure.  She was given a synopsis of the treatment provided as well as written and verbal instructions for postoperative care.  She is to contact to myself with an event of immediate postoperative complications and after full recovery, he was discharged from recovery room in the care of his mother.  She was also given prescription for Tylenol with Codeine Elixir for postoperative pain control.,
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,Briefly, this is a 36-year-old robust Caucasian gentleman with no significant past medical or surgical history, who works as a sales representative, doing a lot of traveling by plane and car and attending several sales shows, developed acute shortness of breath with an episode of syncope this weekend and was brought in by paramedics to Hospital.  A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism.  A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct.  Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today.  He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow.  Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication.  He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Unremarkable.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married and has 1 son.  He has a brother who is healthy.  There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  No family history of hypercoagulable condition.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Advil p.r.n.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Essentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope.  He denied any hemoptysis.  He denied any calf swelling or pain.  Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.,HEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae normal.  Oropharynx normal.,NECK:  No adenopathy or thyromegaly.  No jugular venous distention.,HEART:  Regular.,LUNGS:  Bilateral air entry.,ABDOMEN:  Obese and benign.,EXTREMITIES:  No calf swelling or calf tenderness appreciated.,SKIN:  No petechiae or ecchymosis.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.,LABORATORY FINDINGS:,  Blood count obtained showed a white count of 16.8, hemoglobin 14.8 g percent, hematocrit 44.6%, MCV 94, and platelet count 209,000.  Liver profile normal.  Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3.  Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds.  Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7.  Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.,2.  Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.,3.  Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.,4.  Obesity.,PLAN: , From hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play.  For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin.  In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves.  I discussed at length with the patient's wife at the bedside.
SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.

The patient was placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was then placed under general mask airway and the patient's head was then turned to the left.,The Zeiss operative microscope and medium-sized ear speculum were placed and the cerumen from the external auditory canals were removed with a cerumen loop to #5 suction.  After this, the tympanic membrane is then brought into direct visualization with no signs of any gross retracted pockets or cholesteatoma.  A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant and the middle ear was then suctioned with a #5 suction demonstrating dry contents.  A _____ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed in the myringotomy incision utilizing a alligator forcep.  Cortisporin Otic drops were placed followed by cotton balls.  Attention was then drawn to the left ear with the head turned to the right and the medium sized ear speculum placed.  The external auditory canal was removed off of its cerumen with a #5 suction which led to the direct visualization of the tympanic membrane.  The tympanic membrane appeared with no signs of retraction pockets, cholesteatoma or air fluid levels.  A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant with a myringotomy blade after which a _________ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed with an alligator forcep.  After this, the patient had Cortisporin Otic drops followed by cotton balls placed.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia and transferred to recovery room in stable condition and tolerated the procedure very well.  The patient will be followed up approximately in one week and was sent home with a prescription for Ciloxan ear drops to be used as directed and with instructions not to get any water in the ears.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Morton's neuroma, third interspace, left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Morton's neuroma, third interspace, left foot.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Excision of neuroma, third interspace, left foot.,ANESTHESIA: , General (local was confirmed by surgeon).,HEMOSTASIS: , Ankle pneumatic tourniquet 225 mmHg.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 18 minutes.  Electrocautery was necessary.,INJECTABLES: , 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% Xylocaine, both plain.  Also, 0.5 mL dexamethasone phosphate (4 mg/mL).,INDICATIONS: , Please see dictated H&P for specifics.,PROCEDURE:  ,After proper identification was made, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in supine position.  The patient was then placed under general anesthesia.  A local block was then injected into the third ray of the left foot.  The left foot was then prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate and then draped in the usual sterile technique.  The left foot was then exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and elevated and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed to the third interspace where a longitudinal incision was placed just proximal to the webspace.  The incision was deepened via sharp and blunt dissection with care taken to protect all vital structures.  Identification of the neuroma was made following plantar flexion of the digits.  It was grasped with a hemostat and it was dissected in toto and removed.  It was then sent to pathology.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure was with 4-0 Vicryl in the subcutaneous tissue and then running subcuticular 4-0 nylon suture in the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over that area.  A sterile compressive dressing consisting of saline-soaked gauze, ABD, Kling, Coban was placed over the foot.  The tourniquet was then released.  Good flow was noted to return to all digits.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well.  He left the operating room with all vital signs stable and neurovascular status intact.  The patient went to the recovery.  The patient previously had been given both oral and written preoperative as well as postoperative instructions and a prescription for pain.  The patient will follow up with me in approximately 4 days for dressing change.
PROCEDURE:,  Colonoscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Change in bowel habits and rectal prolapse.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Normal colonoscopy.,PROCEDURE:  ,The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice.  The preparation was poor, but mucosa was visible after lavage and suction.  Small lesions might have been missed in certain places, but no large lesions are likely to have been missed.  The mucosa was normal, was visualized.  In particular, there was no mucosal abnormality in the rectum and distal sigmoid, which is reported to be prolapsing.  Biopsies were taken from the rectal wall to look for microscopic changes.  The anal sphincter was considerably relaxed, with no tone and a gaping opening.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS: , Normal colonic mucosa to the cecum.  No contraindications to consideration of a repair of the prolapse.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right profound mixed sensorineural conductive hearing loss.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right profound mixed sensorineural conductive hearing loss.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Right middle ear exploration with a Goldenberg TORP reconstruction.,ANESTHESIA:,  General ,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS:,  The patient consented to revision surgery because of the profound hearing loss in her right ear.  It was unclear from her previous operative records and CT scan as to whether or not she was a reconstruction candidate.  She had reports of stapes fixation as well as otosclerosis on her CT scan.,At surgery, she was found to have a mobile malleus handle, but her stapes was fixed by otosclerosis.  There was no incus.  There was no specific round window niche.  There was a very minute crevice; however, exploration of this area did not reveal a niche to a round window membrane.  The patient had a type of TORP prosthesis, which had tilted off the footplate anteriorly underneath the malleus handle.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative room and placed in supine position.  The right face, ear, and neck prepped with ***** alcohol solution.  The right ear was draped in the sterile field.  External auditory canal was injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:50,000 epinephrine.  A Fisch indwelling incision was made and a tympanomeatal flap was developed in a 12 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position.  Meatal skin was elevated, middle ear was entered.  This exposure included the oval window, round window areas.  There was a good cartilage graft in place and incorporated into the posterior superior ***** of the drum.  The previous prosthesis was found out of position as it had tilted out of position anteriorly, and there was no contact with the footplate.  The prosthesis was removed without difficulty.  The patient's stapes had an arch, but the ***** was atrophied.  Malleus handle was mobile.  The footplate was fixed.  Consideration have been given to performing a stapedectomy with a tissue seal and then returning later for prosthesis insertion; however, upon inspection of the round window area, there was found to be no definable round window niche, no round window membrane.  The patient was felt to have obliterated otosclerosis of this area along with the stapes fixation.  She is not considered to be a reconstruction candidate under the current circumstances.  No attempt was made to remove bone from the round window area.  A different style of Goldenberg TORP was placed on the footplate underneath the cartilage support in hopes of transferring some sound conduction from the tympanic membrane to the footplate.  The fit was secure and supported with Gelfoam in the middle ear.  The tympanomeatal flap was returned to anatomic position supported with Gelfoam saturated Ciprodex.  The incision was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and individual #5-0 nylon to the skin, and a sterile dressing was applied.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:,1.  Atypical chest pain.,2.  Nausea.,3.  Vomiting.,4.  Diabetes.,5.  Hypokalemia.,6.  Diarrhea.,7.  Panic and depression.,8.  Hypertension.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Serotonin syndrome secondary to high doses of Prozac.,2.  Atypical chest pain with myocardial infarction ruled out.,3.  Diabetes mellitus.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Diarrhea resolved.,ADMISSION SUMMARY: , The patient is a 53-year-old woman with history of hypertension, diabetes, and depression.  Unfortunately her husband left her 10 days prior to admission and she developed severe anxiety and depression.  She was having chest pains along with significant vomiting and diarrhea.  Of note, she had a nuclear stress test performed in February of this year, which was normal.  She was readmitted to the hospital to rule out myocardial infarction and for further evaluation.,ADMISSION PHYSICAL: , Significant for her being afebrile.  Apparently there was one temperature registered mildly high at 100.  Her blood pressure was 140/82, heart rate 83, oxygen saturation was 100%.  She was tearful.  HEART:  Heart sounds were regular.  LUNGS:  Clear.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Apparently there were some level of restlessness and acathexia.  She was also pacing.,ADMISSION LABS:  ,Showed CBC with a white count of 16.9, hematocrit of 46.9, platelets 318,000.  She had 80% neutrophils, no bands.  UA on 05/02 came out negative.  Chemistry panel shows sodium 138, potassium 3.5, creatinine 0.6, calcium 8.3, lactate 0.9, ALT was 39, AST 38, total bilirubin 0.6.  Her initial CK came out at 922.  CK-MB was low.  Troponin was 0.04.  She had a normal amylase and lipase.  Previous TSH few days prior was normal.  Chest x-ray was negative.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,1.  Serotonin syndrome.  After reevaluation of the patient including evaluation of the lab abnormalities it was felt that she likely had serotonin syndrome with obvious restlessness, increased bowel activity, agitation, and elevated white count and CPK.  She did not have fever, tremor or hyperreflexia.  Her CPK improved with IV fluids.  She dramatically improved with this discontinuation of her Prozac.  Her white count came back down towards normal.  At time of discharge, she was really feeling back to normal.,2.  Depression and anxiety with history of panic attacks exacerbated by her husband leaving her 2 weeks ago.  We discussed this.  Also, discussed the situation with a psychiatrist who is available on Friday and I discussed the situation with the patient.  In regards to her medications, we are discontinuing the Prozac and she is being reevaluated by Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Cymbalta has been recommended as a good alternative medication for her.  The patient does have a counselor.  It is going to be difficult for her to go home alone.  I discussed the resources with her.  She has a daughter who will be coming to town in a couple of weeks, but she does have a friend that she can call and stay the next few days with.,3.  Hypertension.  She will continue on her usual medications.,4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She will continue on her usual medications.,5.  Diarrhea resolved.  Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved.  She had received fluid rehydration.,DISPOSITION:,  She is being discharged to home.  She will stay with a friend for a couple of days.  She will be following up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday.  Apparently Dr. Y has already discussed the situation and the plan with her.  She will continue on her usual medications except for discontinuing the Prozac.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: , Include,1.  Omeprazole 20 mg daily.,2.  Temazepam 15 mg at night.,3.  Ativan 1 mg one-half to one three times a day as needed.,4.  Cozaar 50 daily.,5.  Prandin 1 mg before meals.,6.  Aspirin 81 mg.,7.  Multivitamin daily.,8.  Lantus 60 units at bedtime.,9.  Percocet 10/325 one to two at night for chronic pain.  She is running out of that, so we are calling a prescription for #10 of those.
2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM,Multiple views of the heart and great vessels reveal normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships.  Cardiac function is normal.  There is no significant chamber enlargement or hypertrophy.  There is no pericardial effusion or vegetations seen.  Doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with normal tricuspid inflow.  Pulmonary outflow is normal at the valve.  Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium.  The interatrial septum is intact.  Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are normal.  The aortic valve is trileaflet.  The coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins.  The aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient returns for followup evaluation 21 months after undergoing prostate fossa irradiation for recurrent Gleason 8 adenocarcinoma.  His urinary function had been stable until 2 days ago.  Over the past couple of days he has been waking every 1 to 1-1/2 hours and has had associated abdominal cramping, as well as a bit of sore throat (his wife has had a cold for about 2 weeks).  His libido remains intact (but he has not been sexually functional), but his erections have been dysfunctional.  The bowel function is stable with occasional irritative hemorrhoidal symptoms.  He has had no hematochezia.  The PSA has been slowly rising in recent months.  This month it reached 1.2.,PAIN ASSESSMENT: , Abdominal cramping in the past 2 days.  No more than 1 to 2 of 10 in intensity.,PERFORMANCE STATUS: , Karnofsky score 100.  He continues to work full-time.,NUTRITIONAL STATUS: , Appetite has been depressed over the past couple of days, and he has lost about 5 pounds.  (Per him, mostly this week.),PSYCHIATRIC: , Some stress regarding upcoming IRS audits of clients.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Otherwise noncontributory.,MEDICATIONS,1.  NyQuil.,2.  Timolol eye drops.,3.  Aspirin.,4.  Advil.,5.  Zinc.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  Pleasant, well-developed, gentleman in no acute distress.  Weight is 197 pounds.,HEENT:  Sclerae and conjunctivae are clear.  Extraocular movement are intact.  Hearing is grossly intact.  The oral cavity is without thrush.  There is minor pharyngitis.,LYMPH NODES:  No palpable lymphadenopathy.,SKELETAL:  No focal skeletal tenderness.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without palpable mass or organomegaly.,DIGITAL RECTAL EXAMINATION:  There are external hemorrhoids.  The prostate fossa is flat without suspicious nodularity.  There is no blood on the examining glove.,EXTREMITIES:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Without focal deficit.,IMPRESSION:,  Concerning slow ongoing rise in PSA.,PLAN: , Discussed significance of this in detail with the patient.  He understands the probability that there may be residual cancer although the location is unknown.  For now there is no good evidence that early management affects the ultimate prognosis.  Accordingly, he is comfortable with careful monitoring, and I have asked him to return here in 3 months with an updated PSA.  I also suggested that he reestablish contact with Dr. X at his convenience.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Increased work of breathing.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 2-month-old female with a 9-day history of illness.  Per mom's report, the illness started 9 days ago with a dry cough.  The patient was eating normal up until approximately three days ago.  Mom was using a vaporizer at night, which she feels to have helped.  The patient's cough gradually worsened and three days ago, the patient had a significant increasing cough.  At that time, the patient also had significant increasing congestion.  Two days ago the patient was taken to the primary care physician's office and the patient was given Xopenex 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours for home regimen, but this per mom's report, did not help the patient's symptoms.  On Wednesday evening, the patient's congestion and work of breathing increased and the patient was gagging after feedings.  The patient was brought to Children's Hospital Emergency Room at which time the patient was evaluated.  A chest x-ray was obtained and was noted to be normal.  The patient's saturations were noted to be normal and the patient was discharged home.  Last night, the patient was having multiple episodes of emesis after feedings with coughing and today was noted to have decreasing activity.  The patient had a 101 temperature on Wednesday evening, but has had no true fevers.  The patient has had a mild decrease in urine output today and secondary to the persistent increased work of breathing, coughing, and posttussive emesis, the patient was brought to Children's Hospital for reevaluation.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , The remainder of the review of system is otherwise negative, all systems being reviewed, outside of pertinent positives as stated above.,ALLERGIES:,  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,MEDICATIONS:  ,As above.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  None.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,No hospitalizations.  No surgeries.,BIRTH HISTORY: , The patient was born to a G8, P2, A6 mom via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.  Birth weight 6 pounds 12 ounces.  Mom stated she had a uterine infection during her pregnancy and at the time of delivery, but the patient was only in the hospital for 24 hours with mom after delivery.  The patient was full term and mom was noted to have gestational diabetes controlled with diet during her pregnancy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Brother, mother, and father all have asthma.  Mom was noted to have gestational diabetes.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with mother, father, and a brother.  There is one bird.  There are smokers in the household.  There are sick contacts.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 97.7 and pulse is 181, but the patient is fussy.  Respiratory rate ranged between 36 and 44.  The patient is saturating 100% on one-half liter and 89% on room air.,GENERAL APPEARANCE:  Nontoxic child, but with increased work of breathing.  No respiratory distress.,HEENT:  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Anterior fontanelle flat.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Tympanic membranes are clear bilaterally.  Nares are congested.  Mucous membranes are moist without erythema.,NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.,CHEST:  Exhibits symmetric expansion and retractions.,LUNGS:  The patient has diffuse crackles bilaterally, but no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart has a 2/6 vibratory systolic ejection murmur, best heard over the left sternal boarder.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended, and nondistended.  Good bowel sounds noted in all 4 quadrants.,GU:  Normal female.  No discharge or erythema.,BACK:  Normal with a normal curvature.,EXTREMITIES:  A 2+ pulses in the bilateral upper lower extremities.  No evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Capillary refill less than 3 seconds.,LABORATORY DATA: , Labs in the emergency room include a CBC, which showed a white blood cell count of 20.8 with a hemoglobin of 10.7, hematocrit of 31.3 with platelet count of 715,000 with 40% neutrophils, 2 bands, and 70% monocytes.  A urinalysis obtained in the emergency room was noted to be negative.  CRP was noted to be 2.0.  The chest x-ray, reviewed by myself in the emergency room, showed no significant change from previous x-ray, but the patient does has some bronchial wall thickening.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a 2-month-old female who presents to Children's Hospital with examination consistent with bronchiolitis.  At this time, the patient will be placed on the bronchiolitis pathway providing this patient with aggressive suctioning and supplemental oxygen as needed.  Currently, at this time, I feel no respiratory treatments are indicated in this patient.  I hear no evidence of wheezing or reactive airway disease.  We will continue to monitor and reassess this patient closely for this as there is a strong family history of reactive airway disease; however, at this time, the patient will be monitored without any medications and the remainder of the clinical course will be determined by her presentation during the course of this illness.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux rigidus, left foot.,2.  Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux rigidus, left foot.,2.  Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Austin/Youngswick bunionectomy with Biopro implant.,2.  Screw fixation, left foot.,HISTORY: , This 51-year-old male presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time.  The patient desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made.  Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx.  There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease.  There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal.  There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail.  After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact.  The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp.  The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant.  A large was noted to be of the best size.  There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx.  Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base.  A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer.  The bone was noted to be significantly hardened.  The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant.  The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal.  The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process.  The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit.  There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant.,Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal.  A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created.  A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site.  The wedge was then removed in toto.  The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site.  The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position.  The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires.  A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion.  A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion.  With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites.,The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash.  A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl.  Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  A total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected intraoperatively for further anesthesia.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin ES and instructed to take 1 q.  4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. pain.  The patient was instructed to ice and elevate his left lower extremity as much as possible to help decrease postoperative edema.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Fractured right fifth metatarsal.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Fractured right fifth metatarsal.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Open reduction and internal screw fixation right fifth metatarsal.,2.  Application of short leg splint.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY: , This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal.  The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot.  She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain.  She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y.  The consent is available on the chart for review.  The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected.  Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base.  The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal.  An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized.  The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial.  There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view.  A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve.  A linear incision was created with a #10 blade.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached.  Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade.  Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone.  The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus.  A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy.  The fracture site was easily found.  An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis.,A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone.  Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone.  Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone.  Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced.  Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally.  A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly.  All this was done under fluoroscopy.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The fracture site was found to have rigid compression.  The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique.  A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance.  A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied.,A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied.  The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone.  She was given standard postoperative instructions to be non-weightbearing and was dispensed with crutches.  She will rest, ice, and elevate her right leg.  She is to follow up in the clinic on 08/26/03 at 10:30 a.m..  She was given emergency contact numbers and will call or return if problems arise earlier.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 50-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on June 22, 2007.  The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Endstage renal disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Endstage renal disease.,PROCEDURE:,  Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 400 mL.,FLUIDS:  ,One liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,SPECIMEN:  ,None.,DRAIN: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.  Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.

As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant.,Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk.  She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall.  She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests.  She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made.,The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved.  She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.,In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia.  She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing.  She was diagnosed as having "overactive bladder", but the cause of this was never determined.  She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit.  She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.,Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable "stiffness" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles.  Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others.  She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was "not arthritis", but no definite diagnosis was ever established.  She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal.  No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.,However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat.  She states from time-to-time she could "barely walk".  She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were "walking on stilts".  She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit.  She began to tire more easily when walking.,In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.,In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X.  He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine.  He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing.  After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis.  However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003.  Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.,The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex.  She continued on it for about six months.  However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it.  She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy.  So, she discontinued it also.,At that point in time, she decided to try a program of "good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil".,In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities.  She began to have to use a cane.  She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z.  She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak.  Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically.  However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.,She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005).  This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial.  However, it wore off once again.,A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to "look better".  She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.,Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets.  She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs.  She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.,She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.,The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability.  There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Essentially noncontributory.,ALLERGIES:,  The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN.  She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She does not smoke.  She takes one glass of wine per day.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has not had any prior surgeries.  Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:,  The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet.  There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum.  There appear to be Dawson's fingers.  The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.,Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05.  The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.,However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal.  Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord.  It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5F, and weight 124 lb (dressed).,General:  Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.,Head:  Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.,Neck:  Supple, with full range of motion.

Fundi benign.,III, IV, VI:  Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus.  No ptosis.  Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation.,V:  Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally.  Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally.  Motor function normal.,VII:  No facial asymmetry.,VIII:  Hears finger rub bilaterally.  Weber and Rinne tests normal.,IX & X:  Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation.  Gag reflex equal bilaterally.,XI:  Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally.,XII:  Tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations.  Rapid alternating movements normal.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Tone, bulk, and strength are normal in both upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, there is moderate spasticity on the right and moderately severe spasticity on the left.  There are bilateral Achilles' contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture.,Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left):  Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5.  There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements.
REASON FOR VISIT: , This is a cosmetic consultation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a very pleasant 34-year-old white female who is a nurse in the operating room.  She knows me through the operating room and has asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her.  She is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery.  She has recently had some neck surgery for a re-fusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this.  Her current desires are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen, and she came to me mostly because I offer transumbilical breast augmentation.  Her breasts are reportedly healthy without any significant problems.  Her weight is currently stable.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: ,  Negative.  Past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 02/05 and in 09/06.  She has had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for Huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father.  Her brother has an aneurysm.  She does occasionally smoke and has been trying to quit recently.  She is currently smoking about a pack a day.  She drinks about once a week.  She is currently a registered nurse, circulator, and scrub technician in the operating room at Hopkins.  She has no children.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,A 12-system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain, mostly around her neck and thoracic region.  She does have occasional rash on her chest and problems with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain.  She has considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability.  Her last mammogram was in 2000.  She has a size 38C breast.,MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are 5 mg of methadone three times a day and amitriptyline at night as needed.,ALLERGIES: , None.,FINDINGS: , On exam today, the patient has good posture, good physique, good skin tone.  She is tanned.  Her lower abdomen has some excess adiposity.  There is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin.  Her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation.  There was no piercing in that region.  Her breasts are C shaped.  They are not ptotic.  They have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity.  She has no masses or lesions noted.  The nipples are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age.  Her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed.  Hopefully, our scars would be similar to this.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Hypomastia.  I think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely.  This would make her fill out her clothes much better, and I think transumbilical technique in her is a good option.  I have discussed with her the other treatment options, and she does not want scars around her breasts if at all possible.  I think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone.  I think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely.  I am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity, and I will discuss with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem, she may need a mini tummy tuck.  I do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she gets after the adiposity is removed.  I will try to set this up in the near future.  I will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure.  Due to her neck issues, we may not be able to perform her surgery but I will check with Dr. X to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused.
PROCEDURE:,  Punch biopsy of right upper chest skin lesion.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Minimal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PROCEDURE:,  The area around the lesion was anesthetized after she gave consent for her procedure.  Punch biopsy including some portion of lesion and normal tissue was performed.  Hemostasis was completed with pressure holding.  The biopsy site was approximated with non-dissolvable suture.  The area was hemostatic.  All counts were correct and there were no complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She will see us back in approximately five days.,
HEENT:,  No history of headaches, migraines, vertigo, syncope, visual loss, tinnitus, sinusitis, sore in the mouth, hoarseness, swelling or goiter.,RESPIRATORY: , No shortness of breath, wheezing, dyspnea, pulmonary disease, tuberculosis or past pneumonias.,CARDIOVASCULAR: , No history of palpitations, irregular rhythm, chest pain, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diaphoresis, congestive heart failure, heart catheterization, stress test or recent cardiac tests.,GASTROINTESTINAL:,  No history of rectal bleeding, appetite change, abdominal pain, hiatal hernia, ulcer, jaundice, change in bowel habits or liver problems, and no history of inflammatory bowel problems.,GENITOURINARY: , No dysuria, hematuria, frequency, incontinence or colic.,NERVOUS SYSTEM: , No gait problems, strokes, numbness or muscle weakness.,PSYCHIATRIC: , No history of emotional lability, depression or sleep disturbances.,ONCOLOGIC:,  No history of any cancer, change in moles or rashes.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1. XXX upper lid laceration.,2. XXX upper lid canalicular laceration.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1. XXX upper lid laceration.,2. XXX upper lid canalicular laceration.,PROCEDURES:,1. Repair of XXX upper lid laceration.,2. Repair of XXX upper lid canalicular laceration.,ANESTHESIA:, General,SPECIMENS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,INDICATIONS:, This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with XXX eye upper eyelid laceration involving the canaliculus.,PROCEDURE:, The risks and benefits of eye surgery were discussed at length with the patient, including bleeding, infection, re-operation, loss of vision, and loss of the eye. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position, where (s)he was prepped and draped in the routine fashion for general ophthalmic plastic reconstructive surgery, once the appropriate cardiac and respiratory monitoring was placed on him/her, and once general endotracheal anesthetic had been administered. The patient then had the wound freshened up with Westcott scissors and cotton-tip applications. Hemostasis was achieved with a high-temp disposable cautery. Once this had been done, the proximal end of the XXX upper lid canalicular system was intubated with a Monoka tube on a Prolene. The proximal end was then found and this was intubated with the same tubing system. Then, two 6-0 Vicryl sutures were used to reapproximate the medial canthal tendon. Once this had been done, the skin was reapproximated with interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures and interrupted 6-0 plain gut sutures. To ensure that the punctum was in the correct position and in the Monoka tube was seated with a seater, and the tube was cut short. The patient's nose was suctioned of blood, and (s)he was awakened from general endotracheal anesthesia and did well. (S)he left the operating room in good condition.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 1-year-old male patient who was admitted on 12/23/2007 with a history of rectal bleeding.  He was doing well until about 2 days prior to admission and when he passes hard stools, there was bright red blood in the stool.  He had one more episode that day of stool; the stool was hard with blood in it.  Then, he had one episode of rectal bleeding yesterday and again one stool today, which was soft and consistent with dark red blood in it.  No history of fever, no diarrhea, no history of easy bruising.  Excessive bleeding from minor cut.  He has been slightly fussy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Nothing significant.,PREGNANCY DELIVERY AND NURSERY COURSE: , He was born full term without complications.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , None.,SIGNIFICANT ILLNESS AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Negative for heart disease, lung disease, history of cancer, blood pressure problems, or bleeding problems.,DIET:,  Regular table food, 24 ounces of regular milk.

Extraocular movements, conjunctivae and sclerae fair.  Nasal mucosa pink and moist.  Pharynx is clear.,NECK:  Supple without thyromegaly or masses.,LUNGS:  Good air entry bilaterally.  No rales or wheezing.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds positive.  No mass palpable.,GENITALIA:  Normal male.,RECTAL:  Deferred, but there was no perianal lesion.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Full range of movement.  No edema.  No cyanosis.,CNS:  Alert, active and playful.,IMPRESSION: , A 1-year-old male patient with history of rectal bleeding.  Possibilities include Meckel's diverticulum, polyp, infection and vascular malformation.,PLAN:,  To proceed with Meckel scan today.  If Meckel scan is negative, we will consider upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.  We will start colon clean out if Meckel scan is negative.  We will send his stool for C. diff toxin, culture, blood for RAST test for cow milk, soy, wheat and egg.  Monitor hemoglobin.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 53-year-old man, who presented to emergency room with multiple complaints including pain from his hernia, some question of blood in his stool, nausea, and vomiting, and also left lower extremity pain.  At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAM,VITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.,EXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right carotid stenosis.,2.  Prior cerebrovascular accident.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right carotid stenosis.,2.  Prior cerebrovascular accident.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,250 cc.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The common and internal carotid arteries were opened.  A high-grade narrowing was present at the proximal internal carotid and this tapered well to a slightly small diameter internal carotid.  This was repaired with a Dacron patch and the patient tolerated this well under regional anesthetic without need for shunting.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  Longitudinal incisions were made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, carried down through subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The platysmal muscle was divided.  The carotid sheath was identified and opened.  The vagus nerve, ansa cervicalis, and hypoglossal nerves were identified and avoided.  The common internal and external carotids were then freed from the surrounding tissue.  At this point, 10,000 units of aqueous heparin were administered and allowed to take effect.  The external and common carotids were then clamped.  The patient's neurological status was evaluated and found to be unchanged from preoperative levels.,Once sufficient time had lapsed, we proceeded with the procedure.  The carotid bulb was opened with a #11 blade and extended with Potts scissors through the very tight lesion into normal internal carotid.  The plaque was then sharply excised proximally and an eversion endarterectomy was performed successfully at the external.  The plaque tapered nicely on the internal and no tacking sutures were necessary.  Heparinized saline was injected and no evidence of flapping or other debris was noted.  The remaining carotid was examined under magnification, which showed no debris of flaps present.  At this point, a Dacron patch was brought on to the field, cut to appropriate length and size, and anastomosed to the artery using #6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Prior to the time of last stitch, the internal carotid was back-bled through this.  The last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The internal was again gently occluded while flow was restored to the common and external carotids for several moments and then flow was restored to the entire system.  At this point, a total of 50 mg of Protamine was administered and allowed to take effect.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed in layers using #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well.  Sponge, needles, and instrument count were correct.  Estimated blood loss was 250 cc.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Cough and abdominal pain for two days.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 76-year-old female who has a history of previous pneumonia, also hypertension and macular degeneration, who presents with generalized body aches, cough, nausea, and right-sided abdominal pain for two days.  The patient stated that the abdominal pain was only associated with coughing.

ALLOWED CONDITIONS:,  Left knee strain, meniscus tear left knee.,CONTESTED CONDITION:,  Osteoarthritis of the left knee.,EMPLOYER:,  ABCD.,I examined Xxxxx today September 14, 2007, for the above allowed conditions and also the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.  He is a 57-year-old assembly worker who was injured on June 13, 2007, which according to his FROI was due to "repairing cars, down on knees to work on concrete floors."  In addition, he slipped on an air hose on the floor at work on March 7, 2007, re-injuring his left knee.  He developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.,After his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.,Examination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.,QUESTION: , Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx's current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.,ANSWER:, Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.,QUESTION:  ,Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?,ANSWER:, Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.,QUESTION:,  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, and diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER: ,Yes.  Please see the discussion in the answer to question no one.  In addition, x-rays of July 16, 2007, do reveal medial compartment and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis of the left knee.,QUESTION: , If you find this condition exists, is it a direct and proximate result of the June 13, 2002, injury?,ANSWER:, Yes.  See discussion in answer to question number one.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Xxxxx's injury or disability was caused by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of body?,ANSWER: ,No.  I believe the osteoarthritis was the result of the torn medial meniscus as discussed under question number one.,QUESTION: , In addition, if you find the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries, which could have contributed to Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER:, No.  He does not give any history of any intervening injuries.,If you opine the requested condition should be additionally recognized, please include the condition as an allowed condition in the discussion of the following questions.,QUESTION:,  Based on the objective findings is the request for 10 sessions of physical therapy per C-9 dated July 27, 2007, medically necessary and appropriate for the allowed conditions of the claim of osteoarthritis of left knee?,ANSWER:,  Yes.,

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
CIRCUMCISION - OLDER PERSON,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis.  Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona.  The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia.  Next, the foreskin was retracted.  Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona.  The intervening foreskin was excised.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock.  The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges.  Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure.  Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied.  The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
PROBLEM:,  Probable Coumadin hypersensitivity.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old Caucasian female admitted to the Hospital for elective total left knee arthroplasty.  At the time of admission, the patient has a normal prothrombin time and INR of 13.4 seconds and 1.09 respectively and postoperatively, she was placed on Coumadin which is the usual orthopedic surgery procedure for reducing the risk of postoperative thromboembolic activity.  However, the patient's prothrombin time and INR rapidly rose to supratherapeutic levels.  Even though Coumadin was discontinued on 01/21/09, the patient's prothrombin time and INR has continued to rise.  Her prothrombin time is now 83.3 seconds with an INR of 6.52.  Hematology/Oncology consult was requested for recommendation regarding further evaluation and management.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is originally from Maine.  She has lived in Arizona for 4 years.  She has had 2 children; however, only one is living.  She had one child died from complications of ulcerative colitis.  She has been predominantly a homemaker during her life, but has done some domestic cleaning work in the past.,CHILDHOOD HISTORY: , Negative for rheumatic fever.  The patient has usual childhood illnesses.,ALLERGIES:  ,No known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , The patient's mother died from gastric cancer.  She had a brother who died from mesothelioma.  He did have a positive asbestos exposure working in the shipyards.  The patient's father died from motor vehicle accident.  She had a sister who succumbed to pneumonia as a complication to Alzheimer disease.,HABITS: , No use of ethanol, tobacco, illicit, or recreational substances.,ADULT MEDICAL PROBLEMS: , The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which is all consistent with the metabolic syndrome X.  In addition, the patient's husband, who is present, knows that she has early dementia and has problems with memory and difficulty in processing new information.,SURGERIES: , The patient's only surgery is the aforementioned left knee arthroplasty and bilateral cataract surgery, otherwise negative.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient's medications on admission include:,1.  Fosamax.,2.  TriCor.,3.  Gabapentin.,4.  Hydrochlorothiazide.,5.  Labetalol.,6.  Benicar.,7.  Crestor.,8.  Detrol.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Unable to obtain review of systems as the patient was given a dose of morphine for postoperative pain and she is a bit obtunded at this time.  She is arousable, but not particularly conversant.,OBSERVATIONS:,GENERAL:  The patient is a drowsy, but arousable, nonconversant, elderly Caucasian female.,HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are grossly intact.  Oropharynx benign.,NECK:  Supple.  Full range of motion without bruits or thyromegaly.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.,BACK:  Without spine or CVA tenderness.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, thrills, or heaves.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  Positive bowel sounds without mass or visceromegaly.,LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable adenopathy.,EXTREMITIES:  The patient has some postoperative fullness involving her left knee.  She has a dressing over the left knee.,SKIN:  Without lesions.,NEURO:  Unable to assess in light of post morphine obtunded state.,ASSESSMENT: , Hypersensitivity to Coumadin.,PLAN: , Gave the patient vitamin K at this time.  Literature suggested oral vitamin K is actually more efficacious than parenteral.  However, in light of the fact that the patient is obtunded and is not taking anything right now in the way of oral food or fluids, we will give this to her in an IM fashion.  Repeat prothrombin time and INR in a.m.  Once she has come down to a more therapeutic range, I would initiate low-molecular weight heparin in the form of Fragmin one time a day or Lovenox on a b.i.d. schedule for 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute left subdural hematoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute left subdural hematoma.,PROCEDURE:,  Left frontal temporal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This is a 76-year-old man who has a history of acute leukemia.  He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency.  He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury.  His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy.  The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition.  He was fixed in a three-point headrest.  His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol.  We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region.  The scalp was reflected.  A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created.  After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain.  The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline.  After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline.  We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates.  The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment.  Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this.  I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain.
CC:, Fall/loss of consciousness.,HX: ,This 44y/o male fell 15-20feet from a construction site scaffold landing on his head on a cement sidewalk. He was transported directly from the scene, approximately one mile east of UIHC. The patient developed labored breathing and an EMT attempted to intubate the patient in the UIHC ER garage, but upon evaluation in the ER, was found to be in his esophagus and was immediately replaced into the trachea. Replacement of the ET tube required succinylcholine. The patient remained in a C-collar during the procedure. Once in the ER the patient had a 15min period of bradycardia.,MEDS: ,none prior to accident.,PMH:, No significant chronic or recent illness. s/p left knee arthroplasty. h/o hand fractures.,FHX:, Unremarkable.,SHX:, Married.

Babinski signs were present bilaterally.,HEENT: severe facial injury with brain parenchyma and blood from the right nostril. Severe soft tissue swelling about side of head.,Gen Exam: CV: RRR without murmur. Lungs: CTA. Abdomen: distended after ET tube misplacement.,COURSE: ,HCT upon arrival, 10/29/92, revealed: Extensive parenchymal contusions in right fronto-parietal area. Pronounced diffuse brain swelling seemingly obliterates the mesencephalic cistern and 4th ventricle. Considerable mass effect is exerted upon the right lateral ventricle, near totally obliterating its contour. Massive subcutaneous soft tissue swelling is present along the right anterolateral parietal area. There are extensive fractures of the following: two component horizontal fractures throughout the floor of the right middle cranial fossa which includes the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, as well as the greater wing of the sphenoid. Comminuted fractures of the aqueous portion of the temporal bone and parietal bone is noted on the right. Extensive comminution of the right half of the frontal bone and marked displacement is seen. Comminuted fractures of the medial wall of the right orbit and ethmoidal air cells is seen with near total opacification of the air cells. The medial and lateral walls of the maxillary sinus are fractured and minimally displaced, as well as the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus. The right zygomatic bone is fractured at its articulation with the sphenoid bone and displaced posteriorly.,Portable chest, c-spine and abdominal XRays were unremarkable, but limited studies. Abdominal CT was unremarkable.,Hgb 10.4g/dl, Hct29%, WBC17.4k/mm3, Plt 190K. ABG:7.28/48/46 on admission. Glucose 131.,The patient was hyperventilated, Mannitol was administered (1g/kg), and the patient was given a Dilantin loading dose. He was taken to surgery immediately following the above studies to decompress the contused brain and remove bony fragments from multiple skull fractures. The patient remained in a persistent vegetative state at UIHC, and upon the request of this wife his feeding tube was discontinued. He later expired.
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:,  Right coronal synostosis with left frontal compensatory bossing causing plagiocephaly.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Syndromic craniosynostosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Syndromic craniosynostosis.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Anterior cranial vault reconstruction with fronto-orbital bar advancement.,SPECIMENS: , None.,DRAINS: , One subgaleal drain exiting from the left posterior aspect of wound.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was started, the patient was placed on the operating table in supine position with the head held on a horseshoe-shaped headrest and the head was prepped and draped down the routine manner.  Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Chronic renal failure.,2.  Thrombosed left forearm arteriovenous Gore-Tex bridge fistula.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Chronic renal failure.,2.  Thrombosed left forearm arteriovenous Gore-Tex bridge fistula.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Fogarty thrombectomy, left forearm arteriovenous Gore-Tex bridge fistula.,2.  Revision of distal anastomosis with 7 mm interposition Gore-Tex graft.,ANESTHESIA:,  General with controlled ventillation.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 58-year-old black male with chronic renal failure.  He undergoes dialysis through the left forearm bridge fistula and has small pseudoaneurysms at the needle puncture sites level.  There is narrowing at the distal anastomosis due to intimal hypoplasia and the vein beyond it was of good quality.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite, placed in supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Left arm was prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was created just below the antecubital crease just deeper to the subcutaneous tissue.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections segment of the fistula was isolated ________ vessel loop.  Transverse graftotomy was created.  A #4 Fogarty catheter passed proximally and distally restoring inflow and meager inflow.  A fistulogram was performed and the above findings were noted.  In a retrograde fashion, the proximal anastomosis was patent.  There was no narrowing within the forearm graft.  Both veins were flushed with heparinized saline and controlled with a vascular clamp.  A longitudinal incision was then created in the upper arm just deep into the subcutaneous tissue fascia.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissection, the brachial vein as well as distal anastomosis was isolated.  The distal anastomosis amputated off the fistula and oversewn with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture tied upon itself.  The vein was controlled with vascular clamps.  Longitudinal venotomy created along the anteromedial wall.  A 7 mm graft was brought on to the field and this was cut to shape and size.  This was sewed to the graft in an end-to-side fashion with U-clips anchoring the graft at the heel and toe with interrupted #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The vein flushed with heparinized saline and graft was controlled with vascular clamp.  The end of the insertion graft was cut to shape in length and sutured to the graft in an end-to-end fashion with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The graftotomy was then closed with interrupted #6-0 Prolene suture.  Flow through the fistula was permitted, a good flow passed.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needles, instrument counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable sutures.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in apparent stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral fifth toes.,3.  Distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral third and fourth toes.,4.  Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities.

Mucous membranes are moist and free of exudate or lesion.  Bilateral tympanic membranes are visualized and free of infection or trauma.  Dentition shows significant decay throughout the dentition.  The patient has had extraction of teeth 17, 18, and 19.  The patient's tooth #20 does have a small fracture in the posterior section of the tooth and there does appear to be a very minor area of fluctuance and induration located at the alveolar margin at this site.  There is no pus draining from the socket of the tooth.  No other acute abnormality to the other dentition is visualized.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , None.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient does receive an injection of 1.5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine for inferior alveolar nerve block on the left mandibular teeth.  The patient undergoes this all procedure without complication and does report some mild decrease of her pain with this and patient was also given two Vicodin here in the Emergency Department and a dose of Keflex for treatment of her dental infection.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Dental pain with likely dental abscess.  ,PLAN: , The patient was given a prescription for Vicodin.  She is also given prescription for Keflex, as she is penicillin allergic.  She has tolerated a dose of Keflex here in the Emergency Department well without hypersensitivity.  The patient is strongly encouraged to follow up with Dental Clinic on Monday, and she states that she will do so.  The patient verbalizes understanding of treatment plan and was discharged in satisfactory condition from the ER.,
PROCEDURE:,  Cervical epidural steroid injection without fluoroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , Local sedation.,VITAL SIGNS: , See nurse's notes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: , INT was placed.  The patient was in the sitting position.  The posterior neck and upper back were prepped with Betadine.  Lidocaine 1.5% was used for skin wheal made between C7-T1 ________.  An 18-gauge Tuohy needle was placed into the epidural space using loss of resistance technique and no cerebrospinal fluid or blood was noted.  After negative aspiration, a mixture of 5 cc preservative-free normal saline plus 160 mg Depo-Medrol was injected.  Neosporin and band-aid were applied over the site. The patient discharged to recovery room in stable condition.
REASON FOR VISIT: , Follow up consultation, second opinion, foreskin.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 2-week-old who at this point has otherwise been doing well.  He has a relatively unremarkable foreskin.  At this point in time, he otherwise seems to be doing reasonably well.  The question is about the foreskin.  He otherwise has no other significant issues.  Severity low, ongoing since birth two weeks.  Thank you for allowing me to see this patient in consultation.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  Male exam.  Normal and under the penis, report normal uncircumcised 2-week-old.  He has a slightly insertion on the penile shaft from the median raphe of the scrotum.,IMPRESSION: , Slightly high insertion of the median raphe.  I see no reason he cannot be circumcised as long as they are careful and do a very complete Gomco circumcision.  This kid should otherwise do reasonably well.,PLAN:  ,Follow up as needed.  But my other recommendation is that this kid as I went over with the mother may actually do somewhat better if he simply has a formal circumcision at one year of age, but may do well with a person who is very accomplished doing a Gomco circumcision.
INTRODUCTION: , The opinions expressed in this report are those of the physician.  The opinions do not reflect the opinions of Evergreen Medical Panel, Inc.  The claimant was informed that this examination was at the request of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I).  The claimant was also informed that a written report would be sent to L&I, as requested in the assignment letter from the claims manager.  The claimant was also informed that the examination was for evaluative purposes only, intended to address specific injuries or conditions as outlined by L&I, and was not intended as a general medical examination.,CHIEF COMPLAINTS: , This 51-year-old married male presents complaining of some right periscapular discomfort, some occasional neck stiffness, and some intermittent discomfort in his low back relative to an industrial fall that occurred on November 20, 2008.,HISTORY OF INDUSTRIAL INJURY:,  This patient was injured on November 20, 2008.  He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially.,After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned.,Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck.,CURRENT SYMPTOMS:  ,The patient describes his current pain as being intermittent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,Illnesses:  The patient had a diagnosis in 2005 of an acoustic neuroma.  It was benign, but treated neurosurgically.  In February 2004 and again in August 2009 he has had additional treatments for recurrence and he currently has some skull markers in place because radiation is planned as a followup, although the tumor was still indicated to be benign.,Operations:  He has a history of an old mastoidectomy.  He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted.,Medications:  The patient takes occasional Tylenol and occasional Aleve.,Substance Use:,Tobacco:  He does not smoke cigarettes.,Alcohol:  He drinks about five beers a week.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His father died of mesothelioma and his mother died of Lou Gehrig's disease.,SOCIOECONOMIC HISTORY:,Marital Status and Dependents:  The patient has been married three times; longest marriage is of two years duration.  He has two children.  These dependents are ages 15 and twins and are his wife's dependents.,Education:  The patient has bachelor's degree.,Military History:  He served six years in the army and received an honorable discharge.,Work History:  He has worked at Purdy Correctional Institute in Gig Harbor for 19 years.,CHART REVIEW: , Review of the chart indicates a date of injury of November 20, 2008.  He was seen at Tacoma General Hospital with a diagnosis of head contusion and cervical strain.  He had a CT of his head done because of a fall with possible loss of consciousness, which showed a left cerebellar hypodensity and further evaluation was recommended.  He has a history of an old mastoidectomy.  He was then seen on November 24, 2008 by XYZ at Prompt Care on November 24, 2008.  There is no clearcut history that he had lost consciousness.  He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted.  A diagnosis of concussion and cervical strain status post fall was made along with an underlying history of abnormal CT and previous resection of an acoustic neuroma.  Some symptoms of loss of balance and confusion were noted.  She recommended additional testing and neurologic evaluation.,The notes from the treating chiropractor begin on November 24, 2008.  Adjustments are given to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.,He was seen back by XYZ on December 9, 2008 and he had been released to full duties.  It was recognized the new MRI suggested recurrence of the acoustic neuroma and he was advised to seek further care in this regard.  There were some concerns of his feeling of being wobbly since the fall which might be related to the recurrent neuroma.  He continued to have chiropractic adjustments.  He was seen back at Prompt Care on January 8, 2009.  Dr. X indicated that she thought most of his symptoms were related to the tumor, but that the cervical and thoracic stiffness were from the fall.,A followup note by his chiropractor on January 26, 2009 indicates that cervical x-rays have been taken and that continued chiropractic adjustments along with manual traction would be carried out.,On April 13, 2009, he was seen again at Prompt Care for his cervical and thoracic strain.  He was indicated to be improving and there was suggestion that he has some physical therapy and an orthopedic consult was felt appropriate.  Therapy was not carried out and obviously was then involved with the treatment of his recurrent neuroma.,On April 17, 2009, he was seen by Dr. X, another chiropractor for consultation and further chiropractic treatments were recommended based on cervical and thoracolumbar subluxation complexes and strain.,A repeat consult was carried out on April 29, 2009 by XYZ.  He felt that this was hyperextension cervical injury.  It might take a period of time to recover.  He mentioned that the patient might have a slight ulnar neuropathy.  He felt the patient was capable of full duty and the patient was at that time having ongoing treatment for his neuroma.,This concludes the chart review.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , The patient is 6 feet in height, weighs 255 pounds.,Orthopedic Examination:  He can walk with a normal gait, but he has, as indicated, a positive Romberg test and he himself has noticed that if he closes his eyes he loses his balance.  Overall the patient is a seemingly good historian.  There is a visible 3 cm scar at the left base of the neck near the hairline and there are multiple areas where his head has been shaved both anteriorly and posteriorly.  These are secondary to drawing for the skull markers.  There is a scar behind the patient's left ear from the original treatment of the acoustic neuroma.  This was well healed.  The patient can perform a toe-heel gait without difficulty.  One visibly can see that he has some facial asymmetry and he indicates that the acoustic neuroma has caused some numbness in the left side of his face and also some asymmetry that is now recovering.  The patient states he now thinks his recovery is going to get disregarded and that the facial asymmetry and numbness developed from the first surgery he had.  The patient has a full range of motion in both of his shoulders.  The patient has a full range of motion in his lumbar spine to include 90 degrees of forward bend, lateral bending of 30 degrees in either direction and extension of 10 degrees.  There is full range of motion in the patient's cervical spine to include flexion of 50 degrees at which time he can touch his chin on his chest.  He extends 40 degrees, laterally bends 30 degrees, and rotates to 80 degrees in either direction.  There is slight tenderness on palpating over the right cervical musculature.  There is no evidence of any cervical or lumbar muscle spasms.  Reflexes in the upper extremities include 1+ biceps and triceps and 1+ brachioradialis.  Knee jerks are 2+ and ankle jerks are 1+.  Tinel's test was tested at the elbow, it is negative bilaterally with percussion; however, he has slight tingling bilaterally.  The patient's grip tested with a Jamar dynamometer increases from 70 to 80 pounds bilaterally.  Sensory testing of lower extremities reveal that the patient has slightly decreased sensation to sharp stimulus in his dorsal aspect of the right first toe and a lesser extent to the left.  Testing of muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities is normal.  The patient upper arms measured four fingerbreadths above the flexion crease of the elbow measure 35 cm bilaterally.  The forearms measured four fingerbreadths below the flexion crease of the elbow measure 30 cm bilaterally.  The thighs measured four fingerbreadths above the superior pole of the patella measure 48 cm and the lower legs measured four fingerbreadths below the tibial tubercles measure 41 cm.  Pressure on the vertex of the head does not bother the patient.  Axial loading is negative.  As already indicated straight leg raising is entirely negative both sitting and lying for any radiculitis.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , X-rays the patient brings with him taken by his treating chiropractor dated 11/24/08 showed that there appears to be a little bit of narrowing of the L4-5 disc space.  The hip joints are normal.  Views of his thoracic spine are normal.  Cervical x-rays are in the file.  These are of intermittent quality, but the views do show a very slight degree of anterior spurring at the C4-5 with possible slight narrowing of the disc.  There is a view of the right shoulder that is unremarkable.,CONCLUSIONS:,  The accepted condition under the claim is a sprain of the neck, thoracic, and lumbar.,DIAGNOSES: , Diagnosis based on today's examination is a sprain of the cervical spine and lumbar spine superimposed upon some early degenerative changes.,Additional diagnosis is one of recurrent acoustic neuroma, presumably benign with upcoming additional treatment of radiation plan.  The patient also has a significant degree overweight for his height and it will be improved as he himself recognizes by some weight loss and exercise.,DISCUSSION: , He is fixed and stable at this time and his industrial case can be closed relative to his industrial injury of November 20, 2008.  Further chiropractic treatments would be entirely palliative and serve no additional medical purpose due to the fact that he has very minimal symptoms and a basis for these symptoms based on mild or early degenerative changes in both cervical and lumbar spine.  He is category I relative to the cervical spine under 296-20-240 and category I to the lumbosacral spine under WAC 296-20-270.  His industrial case should be closed and there is, as indicated, no basis for any disability award.

Request for cosmetic change with excellent appearance of nose.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURES:,1.  Left ear cartilage graft.,2.  Repair of nasal vestibular stenosis using an ear cartilage graft.,3.  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.,4.  Left inferior turbinectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is with symptomatic nasal obstruction and fixed nasal valve collapse following a previous nasal fracture and attempted repair.  We discussed with the patient the indications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the proposed surgical procedure, she had her questions asked and answered.  Preoperative imaging was performed in consultation with regard to aesthetic results and communicated via the computerized imager.  The patient had questions asked and answered.  Informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was converted to the lounge chair position, and the nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with an inverted going incision and elevation of the skin of the nose in the submucoperichondrial plane over the medial crural footplates and lower lateral cartilages and up over the dorsum.  The septal angle was approached and submucoperichondrial flaps were elevated.  Severe nasal septal deviation to the right hand side and evidence of an old fracture with a separate alignment of the cartilaginous nose from the bony nose was encountered.  The upper laterals were divided and medial and lateral osteotomies were carried out.  Inadequate septal cartilage was noted to be present for use as spreader graft; therefore, left postauricular incision was made, and the conchal bowl cartilage graft was harvested, and it was closed with 3-0 running locking chromic with a sterile cotton ball pressure dressing applied.  Ear cartilage graft was then placed to put two spreader grafts on the left and one the right.  The two on the left extended all the way up to the caudal tip, the one on the right just primarily the medial wall.  It was placed in such a way to correct a caudal dorsal deviation of the nasal tip septum.  The upper lateral cartilage was noted to be of the same width and length in size.  Yet, the left lower cartilage was scarred and adherent to the upper lateral cartilage.  The upper lateral cartilages were noted to be excessive of uneven length with the right being much taller than the left and that was shortened to the same length.  The scar bands were released in the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages to allow free mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages.  A middle crus stitch was used to unite the domes, and then the nose was projected by suturing the medial crural footplates of the caudal septum in deep projected fashion.  Crushed ear cartilage was then placed in the pockets above the spreader grafts in the area of the deficient dorsal nasal height and the lateral nasal sidewall height.  The spreader brought an excellent aesthetic appearance to the nose.  We left more than 1 cm of dorsal and caudal support for the nasal tip and dorsum height.  Mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with 5-0 chromic and 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed on each side of nasal septum and secured with 3-0 nylon and a Denver splint was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy.,OPERATIONS:,1.  Wound debridement x2, including skin, subcutaneous, and muscle.,2.  Insertion of tissue expander to the medial wound.,3.  Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,TOURNIQUET: , None.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,INDICATIONS: , This patient developed a compartment syndrome.  She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Amputation distal phalanx and partial proximal phalanx, right hallux.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY:,  This 44-year-old male patient was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 09/02/2003 with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the right hallux and cellulitis of the right lower extremity.  The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.,He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.  He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Large herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6 with myelopathy (722.21).,2.  Cervical spondylosis.,3.  Cervical stenosis, C5-C6 secondary to above (723.0).,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Large herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6 with myelopathy (722.21).,2.  Cervical spondylosis.,3.  Cervical stenosis, C5-C6 secondary to above (723.0), with surgical findings confirmed.,PROCEDURES: , ,1.  Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 with spinal cord and spinal canal decompression (63075).,2.  Anterior interbody fusion at C5-C6, (22554) utilizing Bengal cage (22851).,3.  Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Uniplate construction, C5-C6, (22845); with intraoperative x-ray times two.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,SERVICE: , Neurosurgery.,OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered.  Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected only in a subplatysmal manner bluntly, and with only blunt dissection at the prevertebral space where a localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained, once self-retaining retractors were placed along the mesial edge of a cauterized longus colli muscle, to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case.  A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.  The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner.  Once the sterile dressing was applied, the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery area having left in stable condition.,At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Non-healing surgical wound to the left posterior thigh.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 49-year-old white male who sustained a traumatic injury to his left posterior thighthis past year while in ABCD.  He sustained an injury from the patellar from a boat while in the water.  He was air lifted actually up to XYZ Hospital and underwent extensive surgery.  He still has an external fixation on it for the healing fractures in the leg and has undergone grafting and full thickness skin grafting closure to a large defect in his left posterior thigh, which is nearly healed right in the gluteal fold on that left area.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low Back Syndrome - Low Back Pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Same.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Bilateral facet Arthrogram at L34, L45, L5S1.,2.  Bilateral facet injections at L34, L45, L5S1.,3.  Interpretation of radiograph.,ANESTHESIA:  ,IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,INDICATION: , Pain in the lumbar spine secondary to facet arthrosis that was demonstrated by physical examination and verified with x-ray studies and imaging scans.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the OR, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  Prior to sedation vitals signs were obtained and were continuously monitored throughout the procedure for amount of pain or changes in pain, EKG, respiration and heart rate and at intervals of three minutes for blood pressure.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral regions were prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine prep and four sterile towels.,The facets in the lumbar regions were visualized with Fluoroscopy using an anterior posterior view.  A skin wheal was placed with 1% Lidocaine at the L34 facet region on the left.  Under fluoroscopic guidance a 22 gauge spinal needle was then placed into the L34 facet on the left side.  This was performed using the oblique view under fluoroscopy to the enable the view of the "Scotty Dog," After obtaining the "Scotty Dog" view the joints were easily seen.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed to verity that there was no venous, arterial or cerebral spinal fluid flow.  After negative aspiration was verified, 1/8th of a cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  Negative aspiration was again performed and 1/2 cc of solution (Solution consisting of 9 cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1 cc of Triamcinolone) was then injected into the joint.  The needle was then withdrawn out of the joint and 1.5 cc of this same solution was injected around the joint.  The 22-gauge needle was then removed.  Pressure was place over the puncture site for approximately one minute.  This exact same procedure was then repeated along the left-sided facets at L45, and L5S1.  This exact same procedure was then repeated on the right side.  At each level, vigilance was carried out during the aspiration of the needle to verify negative flow of blood or cerebral spinal fluid.,The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of the radiograph revealed placement of the 22-gauge spinal needles into the left-sided and right-sided facet joints at, L34, L45, and L5S1.  Visualizing the "Scotty Dog" technique under fluoroscopy facilitated this.  Dye spread into each joint space is visualized.  No venous or arterial run-off is noted.  No epidural run-off is noted.  The joints were noted to have chronic inflammatory changes noted characteristic of facet arthrosis.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Chronic cholecystitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Chronic cholecystitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,CONDITION: , Stable.,DRAINS: , None.,DISPOSITION:  ,To recovery room and to home.,FLUIDS:  ,Crystalloid.,FINDINGS: , Consistent with chronic cholecystitis.  Final pathology is pending.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:  ,Briefly, the patient is a 38-year-old male referred with increasingly severe more frequent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, more after meals, had a positive ultrasound for significant biliary sludge.  He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,
SUBJECTIVE:,  A 6-year-old boy who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy two weeks ago.  Also, I cleaned out his maxillary sinuses.  Symptoms included loud snoring at night, sinus infections, throat infections, not sleeping well, and fatigue.  The surgery went well, and I had planned for him to stay overnight, but Mom reminds me that by about 8 p.m. the night nurse gotten him to take fluids well and we let him go home then that evening.  He finished up his Augmentin, by a day or two later he was off the Lortab.  Mom has not noticed any unusual voice change.  No swallowing difficulty except he does not like the taste of acidic foods such as tomato sauce.  He has not had any nasal discharge or ever had any bleeding.  He seems to be breathing better.,OBJECTIVE:,  Exam looks good.  The pharynx is well healed.  Tongue mobility is normal.  Voice sounds clear.  Nasal passages reveal no discharge or crusting.,RECOMMENDATION:,  I told Mom it is okay to use some ibuprofen in case his mouth or jaws are still sensitive.  He says it seems to hurt if he opens his mouth real wide such as when he brushes his teeth.  It is okay to chew gum and it is okay to eat crunchy foods such as potato chips.  The pathologist described the expected changes of chronic sinusitis and chronic hypertrophic tonsillitis and adenoiditis, and there were no atypical findings on the laboratories.,I am glad he has healed up well.  There are no other restrictions or limitations.  I told Mom, I had written to Dr. XYZ to let her know of the findings.  The child will continue his regular followup visits with his family doctor, and I told Mom I would be happy to see him anytime if needed.  He did very well after surgery and he seems to feel better and breathe a lot better after his throat and sinus procedure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 85-year-old male who was brought in by EMS with a complaint of a decreased level of consciousness.  The patient apparently lives with his wife and was found to have a decreased status since the last one day.  The patient actually was seen in the emergency room the night before for injuries of the face and for possible elderly abuse.  When the Adult Protective Services actually went to the patient's house, he was found to be having decreased consciousness for a whole day by his wife.  Actually the night before, he fell off his wheelchair and had lacerations on the face.  As per his wife, she states that the patient was given an entire mg of Xanax rather than 0.125 mg of Xanax, and that is why he has had decreased mental status since then.  The patient's wife is not able to give a history.  The patient has not been getting Sinemet and his other home medications in the last 2 days.  ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Parkinson disease.,MEDICATIONS:,  Requip, Neurontin, Sinemet, Ambien, and Xanax.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his wife.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:
Her past medical history includes insulin requiring diabetes mellitus for the past 28 years.  She also has a history of gastritis and currently is being evaluated for inflammatory bowel disease.  She is scheduled to see a gastroenterologist in the near future.  She is taking Econopred 8 times a day to the right eye and Nevanac, OD, three times a day.  She is allergic to penicillin.,The visual acuity today was 20/50, pinholing, no improvement in the right eye.  In the left eye, the visual acuity was 20/80, pinholing, no improvement.  The intraocular pressure was 14, OD and 9, OS.  Anterior segment exam shows normal lids, OU.  The conjunctiva is quiet in the right eye.  In the left eye, she has an area of sectoral scleral hyperemia superonasally in the left eye.  The cornea on the right eye shows a paracentral area of mild corneal edema.  In the left eye, cornea is clear.  Anterior chamber in the right eye shows trace cell.  In the left eye, the anterior chamber is deep and quiet.  She has a posterior chamber intraocular lens, well centered and in sulcus of the left eye.  The lens in the left eye shows 3+ nuclear sclerosis.  Vitreous is clear in both eyes.  The optic nerves appear healthy in color and normal in size with cup-to-disc ratio of approximately 0.48.  The maculae are flat in both eyes.  The retinal periphery is flat in both eyes.,Ms. ABC is recovering well from her cataract operation in the right eye with residual corneal swelling, which should resolve in the next 2 to 3 weeks.  She will continue her current drops.  In the left eye, she has an area of what appears to be sectoral scleritis.  I did a comprehensive review of systems today and she reports no changes in her pulmonary, dermatologic, neurologic, gastroenterologic or musculoskeletal systems.  She is, however, being evaluated for inflammatory bowel disease.  The mild scleritis in the left eye may be a manifestation of this.  We will notify her gastroenterologist of this possibility of scleritis and will start Ms. ABC on a course of indomethacin 25 mg by mouth two times a day.  I will see her again in one week.  She will check with her primary physician prior to starting the Indocin.
INDICATION: , Aortic stenosis.,PROCEDURE: , Transesophageal echocardiogram.,INTERPRETATION:  ,Procedure and complications explained to the patient in detail.  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was anesthetized in the throat with lidocaine spray.  Subsequently, 3 mg of IV Versed was given for sedation.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Carpal tunnel syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Carpal tunnel syndrome.,TITLE OF PROCEDURE: , Endoscopic carpal tunnel release.,ANESTHESIA: , MAC,PROCEDURE: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease.  Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion.  Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis.  I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally.  I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area.  Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side.  Great care was taken with placement.  A good plane was positively identified.  I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament.,Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me.  I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament.  I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified.  I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament.  I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament.  I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect.  I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time.  Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut.  Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut.  Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin.  The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Osteoarthritis, right knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Osteoarthritis, right knee.,PROCEDURE:, Right total knee arthroplasty.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful placement of an epidural, as well as general anesthesia, administration 1 gm of Ancef preoperatively, the patient's right thigh, knee and leg were scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for.,A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples. A sterile, bulky compression dressing was placed. The patient was stable on operative release.

She moves with great difficulty because of fatigue and malaise.  Vital signs: Blood pressure 107/80, heart rate: 100 and regular, respirations 22.  HEENT: Normocephalic. No scalp lesions.  Dry eyes with conjuctival injections.  Mild exophthalmos.  Dry nasal mucosa.  Marked cracking and bleeding of her lips with erosion of the mucosa.  She has a large ulceration of the mucosa at the bite margin on the left.  She has some scattered ulcerations on her hard and soft palette.  Tonsils not enlarged.  No visible exudate.  She has difficulty opening her mouth because of pain.  SKIN: She has some mild ecchymoses on her skin and some erythema; she has patches but no obvious skin breakdown.  She has some fissuring in the buttocks crease.  PULMONARY: Clear to percussion in auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR: No murmurs or gallops noted.  ABDOMEN: Protuberant no organomegaly and positive bowel sounds.  NEUROLOGIC EXAM: Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Diffuse hyporeflexia.  MUSCULOSKELATAL: Erosive, destructive changes in the elbows, wrist and hands consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.  She also has bilateral total knee replacements with stovepipe legs and parimalleolar pitting adema 1+.  I feel no pulse distally in either leg.  ,PROBLEMS: ,1.  Swelling of lips and dysphagia with questionable early Stevens-Johnson syndrome.,2.  Rheumatoid Arthritis class 3, stage 4.,3.  Flare of arthritis after discontinuing methotrexate.,4.  Osteoporosis with compression fracture.,5.  Mild dehydration.,6.  Nephrolithiasis.,PLAN:, Patient is admitted for IV hydration and treatment of oral ulcerations.  We will obtain a dermatology consult.  IV leucovorin will be started, and the patient will be put on high-dose corticosteroids.
SUBJECTIVE: , The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.  ,OBJECTIVE: , The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15.  Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact.  Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities.  Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception.  Cerebellar exam is intact.  Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes.  Speech is appropriate.  Judgment is intact.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme.  We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing.  Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma.  The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor.  He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night.  He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning.  He has undergone vocational rehab assessment.

Hammertoe repair, right fifth toe.,4.  Extensor tenotomy and capsulotomy, right fourth metatarsophalangeal joint.,5.  Modified Tailor's bunionectomy, right fifth metatarsal.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY:,  This 51-year-old female presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for surgery on her painful right foot bunion, hammer toes, and Tailor's bunion.  The patient has a long history of crippling severe rheumatoid arthritis.  She has pain with shoe gear and pain with every step.  She has tried multiple conservative measures under Dr. X's supervision consisting of wide shoe's and accommodative padding all which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical reconstruction/correction.  The consent is available on the chart for review and the risks versus benefits of this procedure have been discussed with patient in detail by Dr. X.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field.  The sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe.  In addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray.  There was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal.  Using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection.  The joint capsule was then visualized.  Two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule.  A dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal  phalanx.,A large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint.  In addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal.  Upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head.  A sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare.  Next, the bone was passed out as specimen.  The head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation.  The tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue.  This was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed.  The fibular sesamoid was in the interspace.  A lateral release was performed in addition.  Next, the McGlamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed.  The metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure.  Next, the Biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint.  A small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx.  The trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed.,Next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A median large porous Biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position.  It had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level.  Next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion.  A medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature.  There was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.,Next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint.  The tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  The bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded.  The base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage.  A sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  Next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft.  The toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position.  An extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated.  The same suture material was used and the same 0.045 Kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation.,Attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated.  The same suture material was used.  However, a 0.062 Kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 Kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight.  Next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  The toe assumed to more rectus position.  The reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces.  The joint was again flushed with saline.  Next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  The skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique.,Next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin.  A #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively.  Next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  Hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly.  A sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  A bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures.  The skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 Monocryl.  Attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated.  Therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The tendon was transected.  Next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed.  Next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position.  One #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin.,Mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds.  Betadine-soaked Owen silk was applied to all wounds.  Betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  All the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped.  A standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  She was given prescription for Tylenol #3, #40 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c.  She is to continue her rheumatoid arthritis drugs preoperatively prescribed by the rheumatologist.,She is to follow up with Dr. X in the office.  She was given emergency contact numbers and standard postoperative instructions.  She was given Darco OrthoWedge shoe and a pair of crutches.  She was discharged in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right distal both-bone forearm fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right distal both-bone forearm fracture.,INDICATIONS:,  Mr. ABC is a 10-year-old boy who suffered a fall resulting in a right distal both-bone forearm fracture.  Upon evaluation by Orthopedic Surgery team in the emergency department, it was determined that a closed reduction under conscious sedation and application of a splint was warranted.  This was discussed with the parents who expressed verbal and written consent.,PROCEDURE:,  Conscious sedation was achieved via propofol via the emergency department staff.  Afterwards, traction with re-creation of the injury pattern was utilized to achieve reduction of the patient's fracture.  This was confirmed with image intensifier.  Subsequently, the patient was placed into a splint.  The patient was aroused from conscious sedation and at this time it was noted that he had full sensation throughout radial, median, and ulnar nerve distributions and positive extensor pollicis longus, flexor pollicis longus, dorsal and palmar interossei.,DISPOSITION:  ,Post-reduction x-rays revealed good alignment in the AP x-rays.  The lateral x-rays also revealed adequate reduction.  At this time, we will allow the patient to be discharged home and have him follow up with Dr. XYZ in one week.

The OssaTron equipment was brought into the field and the nose piece for treatment was placed against the lateral epicondyle targeting the area previously determined with the patient's input of maximum pain.  Then using standard extracorporeal shockwave protocol, the OssaTron treatment was applied to the lateral epicondyle of the elbow.  After completion of the treatment, the tourniquet was deflated, and the patient was returned to the holding area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Visually significant nuclear sclerotic cataract, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Visually significant nuclear sclerotic cataract, right eye.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: , Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, right eye.,ANESTHESIA:,  Monitored anesthesia care with retrobulbar block consisting of 2% lidocaine in an equal mixture with 0.75% Marcaine and Amphadase.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:,  This patient has been experiencing difficulty with eyesight regarding activities of daily living.  There has been a progressive and gradual decline in the visual acuity.  The cataract was believed related to her decline in vision.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives (including with observation or spectacles) were discussed in detail.  The risks as explained included, but are not limited to pain, bleeding, infection, decreased or loss of vision/loss of eye, retinal detachment requiring further surgery, and possible consultation out of town, swelling of the back part of the eye/retina, need for prolonged eye drop use or injections, instability of the lens, and loss of corneal clarity necessitating long-term drop use or further surgery.  The possibility of needing intraocular lens exchange or incorrect lens power was discussed.  Anesthesia option and risks associated with anesthesia and retrobulbar anesthesia were discussed.  It was explained that some or all of these complications might arise at the time of or months to years after surgery.  The patient had a good understanding of the risks with the proposed, elective eye surgery.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was signed and placed in the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After intravenous sedation, the retrobulbar block was injected followed by several minutes of digital massage.  No signs of orbital tenseness or retrobulbar hemorrhage were present.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  An eyelid speculum was used to separate the eyelids.  A crescent blade was used to make a clear corneal temporally located incision.  A 1-mm Dual-Bevel blade was used to make a paracentesis site.  The anterior chamber was filled with viscoelastic (Viscoat).  The crescent blade was then used to make an approximate 2-mm long clear corneal tunnel through the temporal incision.  A 2.85-mm keratome blade was then used to penetrate into the anterior chamber through the temporal tunneled incision.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsulorrhexis was completed with the Utrata forceps.  A 27-guage needle was used for hydrodissection and three full and complete fluid waves were noted.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer ultrasound was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove all remaining cortex.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  An AMO model SI40NB posterior chamber intraocular lens with power *** diopters and serial number *** was injected into the capsular bag.  The trailing haptic was placed with the Sinskey hook.  The lens was made well centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and eccentric posterior chamber intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Vigamox and Econopred drops were applied.  A soft eye patch followed by a firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.  All questions were answered.  The discharge instructions were also reviewed with the patient by the discharging nurse.  The patient was comfortable and was discharged with followup in 24 hours.  Complications none.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Penoscrotal abscess.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Penoscrotal abscess.,OPERATION: , Incision and drainage of the penoscrotal abscess, packing, penile biopsy, cystoscopy, and urethral dilation.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 75-year-old male presented with penoscrotal abscess.  Options such as watchful waiting, drainage, and antibiotics were discussed.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, completely the infection turning into necrotizing fascitis, Fournier's gangrene were discussed.  The patient already had significant phimotic changes and disfigurement of the penis.  For further debridement the patient was told that his penis is not going to be viable, he may need a total or partial penectomy now or in the future.  Risks of decreased penile sensation, pain, Foley, other unexpected issues were discussed.  The patient understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAIL OF THE OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Pictures were taken prior to starting the procedure for documentation.  The patient had an open sore on the right side of the penis measuring about 1 cm in size with pouring pus out using blunt dissection.  The penile area was opened up distally to allow the pus to come out.  The dissection around the proximal scrotum was done to make sure there are no other pus pockets.  The corporal body was intact, but the distal part of the corpora was completely eroded and had a fungating mass, which was biopsied and sent for permanent pathology analysis.,Urethra was identified at the distal tip, which was dilated and using 23-French cystoscope cystoscopy was done, which showed some urethral narrowing in the distal part of the urethra.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal.  The prostatic urethra was slightly enlarged.  There are no stones or tumors inside the bladder.  There were moderate trabeculations inside the bladder.  Otherwise, the bladder and the urethra appeared normal.  There was a significantly fungating mass involving the distal part of the urethra almost possibility to have including the fungating wart or fungating squamous cell carcinoma.  Again biopsies were sent for pathology analysis.  Prior to urine irrigation anaerobic aerobic cultures were sent, irrigation with over 2 L of fluid was performed.  After irrigation, packing was done with Kerlix.  The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.  Please note that 18-French Foley was kept in place.  Electrocautery was used at the end of the procedure to obtain hemostasis as much as possible, but there was fungating mass with slight bleeding packing was done and tight scrotal Kling was applied.  The patient was brought to Recovery in a stable condition after applying 0.5% Marcaine about 20 mL were injected around for local anesthesia.
Initially a small incision was made in the right superior hemiscrotum and the incision was carried down to the vas deferens.  This incision was carried down to the area of the previous vasectomy.  A towel clip was placed around this.  Next the scarred area was dissected free back to normal vas proximally and distally.  Approximately 4 cm of vas was freed up.  Next the vas was amputated above and below the scar tissue.  Fine hemostats were used to grasp the adventitial tissue on each side of the vas, both the proximal and distal ends.  Both ends were then dilated very carefully with lacrimal duct probes up to a #2 successfully.  After accomplishing this, fluid could be milked from the proximal vas which was encouraging.,Next the reanastomosis was performed.  Three 7-0 Prolene were used and full thickness bites were taken through the muscle layer of the vas deferens and into the lumen.  This was all done with 3.5 loupe magnification.  Next the vas ends were pulled together by tying the sutures.  A good reapproximation was noted.  Next in between each of these sutures two to three of the 7-0 Prolenes were used to reapproximate the muscularis layer further in an attempt to make this fluid-tight.,There was no tension on the anastomosis and the vas was delivered back into the right hemiscrotum.  The subcuticular layers were closed with a running 3-0 chromic and the skin was closed with three interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.,Next an identical procedure was done on the left side.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.  Antibiotic ointment, fluffs, and a scrotal support were placed.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Left flank pain, ureteral stone.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 76-year-old female who was referred to us from Dr. X for left flank pain.

Options such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, and shockwave lithotripsy were discussed.  The patient has a pretty enlarged stone.  Failure of the procedure if the stone is significantly impacted into the ureteral wall was discussed.  The patient understood that the success of the surgery may be or may not be 100%, that she may require shockwave lithotripsy if we are unable to get the entire stone out in one sitting.  The patient understood all the risk, benefits of the procedure and wanted to proceed.  Need for stent was also discussed with the patient.  The patient will be scheduled for surgery tomorrow.  Plan for continuation of the antibiotics, obtain urinalysis and culture, and plan for KUB to evaluate for the exact location of the stone prior to surgery tomorrow.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 48-year-old male who was initially seen in the emergency room on Monday with complaints of scapular pain.  The patient presented the following day with subcutaneous emphysema and continued complaints of pain as well as change in his voice.  The patient was evaluated with a CT scan of the chest and neck which demonstrated significant subcutaneous emphysema, a small right-sided pneumothorax, but no other findings.  The patient was admitted for observation.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Hernia repair and tonsillectomy.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin.,MEDICATIONS: , Please see chart.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Not contributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Well developed, well nourished, lying on hospital bed in minimal distress.,HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.

These are likely a result of either a parenchymal lung tear versus a small tracheobronchial tree rend.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  At this time, the CT Surgery service has been consulted and has left recommendations.  The patient also is awaiting bronchoscopy per the Pulmonary Service.  At this time, there are no General Surgery issues.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient denies any significant past medical history.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies any significant surgical history.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient takes no medications.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She denies use of cigarettes, alcohol or drugs.,FAMILY HISTORY: , No family history of birth defects, mental retardation or any psychiatric history.,DETAILS: , I performed a transabdominal ultrasound today using a 4 MHz transducer.  There is a twin gestation in the vertex transverse lie with an anterior placenta and a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding both of the twins.  The fetal biometry of twin A is as follows.  The biparietal diameter is 4.9 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, head circumference 17.6 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 1 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, and femur length is 3.1 cm consistent with 19 weeks and 5 days, and the humeral length is 3.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day.  The average gestational age by ultrasound is 20 weeks and 1 day and the estimated fetal weight is 353 g.  The following structures are seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey, the shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels and the placenta.,Limited in views of baby A with a nasolabial region.,The following is the fetal biometry for twin B. The biparietal diameter is 4.7 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, head circumference 17.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, the femur length is 3.3 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 3 days, and the humeral length is 3.1 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, the average gestational age by ultrasound is 22 weeks and 2 days, and the estimated fetal weight is 384 g.  The following structures were seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey.  The shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels, and the placenta.  Limited on today's ultrasound the views of nasolabial region.,In summary, this is a twin gestation, which may well be monochorionic at 20 weeks and 1 day.  There is like gender and a single placenta.  One cannot determine with certainty whether or not this is a monochorionic or dichorionic gestation from the ultrasound today.,I sat with the patient and her husband and discussed alternative findings and the complications.  We focused our discussion today on the association of twin pregnancy with preterm delivery.  We discussed the fact that the average single intrauterine pregnancy delivers at 40 weeks' gestation while the average twin delivery occurs at 35 weeks' gestation.  We discussed the fact that 15% of twins deliver prior to 32 weeks' gestation.  These are the twins which we have the most concern regarding the long-term prospects of prematurity.  We discussed several etiologies of preterm delivery including preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction.  We discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth.  We discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia.  We also discussed treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids.  I would recommend that the patient return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being.,In closing, I do want to thank you very much for involving me in the care of your delightful patient.  I did review all of the above findings and recommendations with the patient today at the time of her visit.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I could be of any further help to you.,Total visit time 40 minutes.
PROCEDURE:  ,The site was cleaned with antiseptic.  A local anesthetic (2% lidocaine) was given at each site.  A 3 mm punch biopsy was performed in the left calf and left thigh, above the knee.  The site was then checked for bleeding.  Once hemostasis was achieved, a local antibiotic was placed and the site was bandaged.,The patient was not on any anticoagulant medications.  There were also no other medications which would affect the ability to conduct the skin biopsy.  The patient was further instructed to keep the site completely dry for the next 24 hours, after which a new Band-Aid and antibiotic ointment should be applied to the area.  They were further instructed to avoid getting the site dirty or infected.  The patient completed the procedure without any complications and was discharged home.,The biopsy will be sent for analysis.,The patient will follow up with Dr. X within the next two weeks to review her results.
TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,1.  Secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant with penetrating keratoplasty.,2.  A concurrent vitrectomy and endolaser was performed by the vitreoretinal team.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  ,The patient is a 62-year-old white male who underwent cataract surgery in 09/06.  This was complicated by posterior capsule rupture.  An intraocular lens implant was not attempted.  He developed corneal edema and a preretinal hemorrhage.  He is aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery and now wishes to proceed with secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant in the left eye, vitrectomy, endolaser, and penetrating keratoplasty.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.  Preretinal hemorrhage.,2.  Diabetic retinopathy.,3.  Aphakia.,4.  Corneal edema.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.  Preretinal hemorrhage.,2.  Diabetic retinopathy.,3.  Aphakia.,4.  Corneal edema.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,SPECIMEN:  ,1.  Donor corneal swab sent to Microbiology.,2.  Donor corneal scar rim sent to Eye Pathology.,3.  The patient's cornea sent to Eye Pathology.,PROS DEV IMPLANT:  ,ABC Laboratories 16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,NARRATIVE: , Informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.  No qualified resident was available to assist.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Gross hematuria.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Gross hematuria.,OPERATIONS:  ,Cystopyelogram, clot evacuation, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor x2 on the dome and on the left wall of the bladder.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,FINDINGS:  ,Significant amount of bladder clots measuring about 150 to 200 mL, two cupful of clots were removed.  There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side.  The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs.  The patient had hematuria.  Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy.  The patient came in again with gross hematuria.  The first biopsy was done about a month ago.  The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria.  The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed.  Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed.  Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed.  The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder.  There was a tight bladder neck contracture.  The prostate was not enlarged.  Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed.  It took about half an hour to just remove the clots.  After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected.  This was lateral to the left ureteral opening.  The base was coagulated for hemostasis.  Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized.  The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal.  Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal.  The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots.  The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening.  A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation.  The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal.  At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started.  The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Closed displaced angulated fracture of the right distal radius.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Closed displaced angulated fracture of the right distal radius.,PROCEDURE: , Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist using an Acumed locking plate.,ANESTHESIA: , General laryngeal mask airway.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 40 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 23-year-old gentleman who was involved in a crush injury to his right wrist.  He was placed into a well-molded splint after reduction was performed in the emergency department.  Further x-rays showed further distal fragment dorsal angulation that progressively worsened and it was felt that surgical intervention was warranted.  All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of the surgery were explained to the patient in detail, and he signed the informed consent for ORIF of the right wrist.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operative table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The right upper extremity had a well-padded tourniquet placed on the right arm, which was insufflated and maintained for 40 minutes at 250 mmHg pressure.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 5-cm incision was made over the flexor carpi radialis of the right wrist.  The skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the deep tissue was retracted, blunt dissection was performed down to the pronator quadratus.  Sharp dissection was performed through the pronator quadratus after which a tissue elevator was used to elevate this tissue.  Next, a reduction was performed placing the distal fragment into appropriate alignment.  This was checked under fluoroscopy, and was noted to be adequately reduced and in appropriate position.  An Acumed Accu-lock plate was placed along the volar aspect of the distal radius.  This was checked under AP and lateral views with C-arm, noted to be in appropriate alignment.  A 3.5-mm cortical screw was placed through the proximal aspect of the plate, positioned it into position.  Two distal locking screws were placed along the plate itself.  The screws were checked under AP and lateral views noting the fracture fragment was well aligned and appropriately reduced with the 2 screws being placed into appropriate position with the appropriate length as well as not being intraarticular.  Four more screws were placed along the distal aspect of the plate and 2 more proximal along the plate.  All locking screws placed into position and had excellent purchase into the bone or had excellent fixation into the plate and maintained the alignment of the fracture.  AP and lateral views were taken of these screw placements again.  None of these screws were into the joint and all had appropriate length into the dorsal cortex.  Two more 3.5 fully threaded cortical screws were placed along the proximal aspect of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase.  AP and lateral views were taken of the wrist once again showing that this was appropriate reduction of the fracture as well as appropriate placement of the screws.  Bicortical purchase was appreciated and no screws were placed into the joint.  The wound itself was copiously irrigated with saline and Kantrex after which the subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 nylon stitch; 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the wound site after which sterile dressing was placed as well as the volar splint.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic, transferred to the hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Chronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Chronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,BRIEF DESCRIPTION: , The patient was brought to the operating room and anesthesia was induced.  The abdomen was prepped and draped and ports were placed.  The gallbladder was grasped and retracted.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were circumferentially dissected and a critical view was obtained.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided and the gallbladder was dissected off the liver bed with electrocautery and placed in an endo catch bag.  The gallbladder fossa and clips were examined and looked good with no evidence of bleeding or bile leak.  The ports were removed under direct vision with good hemostasis.  The Hasson was removed.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The gallbladder in its endo catch bag was removed.  The ports were closed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Please see full hospital dictation.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe degenerative joint disease of the right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Severe degenerative joint disease of the right shoulder.,PROCEDURE: , Right shoulder hemi-resurfacing using a size 5 Biomet Copeland humeral head component, noncemented.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.  The patient was taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had increased pain in to her right shoulder.  X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.  Drill holes were made into the humeral head after which a size 5 Copeland hemi-resurfacing component was placed into the humeral head, kept down in appropriate position, had excellent fixation into the humeral head.  Excess bone that had been reamed was placed into the Copeland metal component, after which this was tapped into position.  After which the wound site was copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics and the humeral head was reduced and taken through range of motion; had adequate range of motion, full internal and external rotation as well as forward flexion and abduction.  There was no gross sign of dislocation.  Wound site once again it was copiously irrigated with saline antibiotics.  The subscapularis tendon was approximated back into position with #2 Ethibond after which the bicipital tendon did have significant tear to it; therefore it was tenodesed in to the pectoralis major tendon.  After which, the wound site again was irrigated with saline antibiotics after which subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was placed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic and transferred to hospital gurney to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Gallstone pancreatitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Gallstone pancreatitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal and local injectable Marcaine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , Gallbladder.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Video laparoscopy revealed dense omental adhesions surrounding the gallbladder circumferentially.  These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes.  The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally.  The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally.  The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver.  There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously.  Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia.  She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination.  Her transaminases were markedly elevated.  She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones.  Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis.  She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis.  Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.  She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created.  Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings.  The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed.  A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline.  The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament.  Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line.  These were inserted without difficulty.  The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder.  Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions.  Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct.  A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch.  This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place.  Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly.  Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.,Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall.  The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port.  There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder.  Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty.  The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia.  A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions.  The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine.  All ports were then cleaned dry.  Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this.  The patient tolerated the entire procedure well.  She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  She will be followed closely in the postoperative course in General Medical Floor.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Recurrent abscesses in the thigh, as well as the pubic area for at least about 2 years.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  A 23-year-old female who is approximately 5 months' pregnant, who has had recurrent abscesses in the above-mentioned areas.  She would usually have pustular type of lesion that would eventually break and would be quite painful.  The drainage would be malodorous.  It would initially not be infected as far as she knows, but then could eventually become infected.  She stated that this first started after she had her first born about 2 years ago.  She had recurrences of these abscesses and had pain, actually hospitalized at Hospital approximately a year and a half ago for about 1-1/2 months.  She was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics.  She had biopsies done.  She was seen by Dr. X.  Reportedly, she had a HIV test done that was negative.  She had been seen by a dermatologist who said that she had a problem with her sweat glands.  She has been on multiple courses of antibiotics.  She never had any fevers.

Abrasion/contusion, posterior right shoulder.,V. Abrasions of left lower back and posterior left lower leg.,VI. Abrasion and vancular congestion of vaginal mucosa.,VII. Ligature of right wrist.,TOXICOLOGIC STUDIES ,Blood ethanol - none detected.,Blood drug screen - no drugs detected.,CLINOCOPATHOLIGICAL CORRELATION:, Cause of death of this six year old female is asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma. ,The body of this six year old female was first seen by me after I was called to an address XYZ, on 12/26/96. I arrived at the scene approximately 8 PM on 12/26 and entered the house where the decedent's body was located at approximately 8:20 PM. ,A brief examination of the body disclosed a ligature around the neck and a ligature around the right wrist. Also noted was a small area of abrasion or contusion below the right ear on the lateral aspect of the right cheek. A prominent dried abrasion was present on the lower left neck. After examining the body, I left the residence at approximately 8:30 PM. ,EXTERNAL EVIDENCE OF INJURY:, Located just below the right ear at the right angle of the mandible, 1.5 inches below the right external auditory canal is a 3/8 x 1/4 inch area of rust colored abrasion. In the lateral aspect of the left lower eyelid on the inner conjunctival surface is a 1 mm in maximum dimension petechial hemorrhage. Very fine, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin of the upper eyelids bilaterally as well as on the lateral left cheek. On everything the left upper eyelid there are much smaller, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages located on the conjunctival surface. Possible petechial hemorrhages are also seen on the conjunctival surfaces of the right upper and lower eyelids, but liver mortis on this side of the face makes definite identification difficult. ,A deep ligature furrow encircles the entire neck. The width of the furrow varies from one- eight of an inch to five/sixteenths of an inch and is horizontal in orientation, with little upward deviation. The skin of the anterior neck above and below the ligature furrow contains areas of petechial hemorrhage and abrasion encompassing an area measuring approximately 3 x 2 inches. The ligature furrow crosses the anterior midline of the neck just below the laryngeal prominence, approximately at the level of the cricoid cartilage. It is almost completely horizontal with slight upward deviation from the horizontal towards the back of the neck. The midline of the furrow mark on the anterior neck is 8 inches below the top of the head. The midline of the furrow mark on the posterior neck is 6.75 inches below the top of the head. ,The area of abrasion and petechial hemorrhage of the skin of the anterior neck includes on the lower left neck, just to the left of the midline, a roughly triangular, parchment-like rust colored abrasion which measures 1.5 inches in length with a maximum width of 0.75 inches. This roughly triangular shaped abrasion is obliquely oriented with the apex superior and lateral. The remainder of the abrasions and petechial hemorrhages of the skin above and below the anterior projection of the ligature furrow are nonpatterned, purple to rust colored, and present in the midline, right, and left areas of the anterior neck. The skin just above the ligature furrow along the right side of the neck contains petechial hemorrhage composed of multiple confluent very small petechial hemorrhages as well as several larger petechial hemorrhages measuring up to one-sixteenth and one-eight of an inch in maximum dimension. Similar smaller petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin below the ligature furrow on the left lateral aspect of the neck. Located on the right side of the chin is a three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch area of superficial abrasion. On the posterior aspect of the right shoulder is a poorly demarcated, very superficial focus of abrasion/contusion which is pale purple in color and measures up to three-quarters by one-half inch in maximum dimension. Several linear aggregates of petechial hemorrhages are present in the anterior left shoulder just above deltopectoral groove. These measure up to one inch in length by one-sixteenth to one-eight of an inch in width. On the left lateral aspect of the lower back, approximately sixteen and one-quarter inches and seventeen and one-half inches below the level of the top of the head are two dried rust colored to slightly purple abrasions. The more superior of the two measures one-eight by one-sixteenth of an inch and the more inferior measures three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch. There is no surrounding contusion identified. On the posterior aspect of the left lower leg, almost in the midline, approximately 4 inches above the level of the heel are two small scratch-like abrasions which are dried and rust colored. They measure one-sixteenth by less than one- sixteenth of an inch and one-eight by less than one-sixteenth of an inch respectively. ,On the anterior aspect of the perineum, along the edges of closure of the labia majora, is a small amount of dried blood. A similar small amount of dried and semifluid blood is present on the skin of the fourchette and in the vestibule. Inside the vestibule of the vagina and along the distal vaginal wall is reddish hyperemia. This hyperemia is circumferential and perhaps more noticeable on the right side and posteriorly. The hyperemia also appears to extend just inside the vaginal orifice. A 1 cm red-purple area of abrasion is located on the right posterolateral area of the 1 x 1 cm hymeneal orifice.

SUBJECTIVE: , I am following the patient today for immune thrombocytopenia.  Her platelets fell to 10 on 01/09/07 and shortly after learning of that result, I increased her prednisone to 60 mg a day.  Repeat on 01/16/07 revealed platelets up at 43.  No bleeding problems have been noted.  I have spoken with her hematologist who recommends at this point we decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days and then go down to 20 mg a day.  The patient had been on 20 mg every other day at least for a while, and her platelets hovered at least above 20 or so.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vitals:  As in chart.  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  She is in no apparent distress.  The petechial areas on her legs have resolved.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Patient with improvement of her platelet count on burst of prednisone.  We will decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days, then go down to 20 mg a day.  Basically thereafter, over time, I may try to sneak it back a little bit further.  She is on medicines for osteoporosis including bisphosphonate and calcium with vitamin D.  We will arrange to have a CBC drawn weekly.,
REASON FOR VISIT: , Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 56-year-old noted to have microscopic hematuria with overactive bladder.  Her cystoscopy performed was unremarkable.  She continues to have some episodes of frequency and urgency mostly with episodes during the day and rare at night.  No gross hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, no other outlet obstructive and/or irritative voiding symptoms.  The patient had been previously on Ditropan and did not do nearly as well.  At this point, what we will try is a different medication.  Renal ultrasound is otherwise unremarkable, notes no evidence of any other disease.,IMPRESSION: , Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria most likely some mild atrophic vaginitis is noted.  She has no other significant findings other than her overactive bladder, which had continued.  At this juncture what I would like to do is try a different anticholinergic medication.  She has never had any side effects from her medication.,PLAN: , The patient will discontinue Ditropan.  We will start Sanctura XR and we will follow up as scheduled.  Otherwise we will continue to follow her urinalysis over the next year or so.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left renal mass, left renal bleed.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Left renal mass, left renal bleed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left laparoscopic hand-assisted nephrectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,EBL: , 100 mL.,The patient had a triple-lumen catheter A-line placed.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  The patient is a 54-year-old female with history of diabetic nephropathy, diabetes, hypertension, left BKA, who presented with abdominal pain with left renal bleed.  The patient was found to have a complex mass in the upper pole and the lower pole of the kidney.  MRI and CAT scan showed questionable renal mass, which could be malignant.  Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy.  At this point, the patient was unable to go home.  The patient continually complained of pain.  The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior.  The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5.  The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.,Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed.  Cardiac clearance was obtained.  The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk.  The recommendation from the pulmonologist, cardiologist, and medical team was to get the kidney out at this point because the patient and the family stated that they would not do well at home without any intervention.  The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter.  The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position.  All the pressure points were well padded.  The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it.  Axilla was protected.  The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.  The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape.  OG and a Foley catheter were in place.  A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply.  There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck.  The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line.  The colon was reflected medially.  Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly.  There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out.  Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially.  The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure.  They were stable all throughout.  Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.,The dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney.  The adrenal was preserved.  The entire kidney was removed through the hand port.  Irrigation was performed.  There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy.  Fibrin glue and Surgicel were applied just in case the patient had delayed DIC.  The colon was placed back and 12-mm ports were closed under direct palpation using 0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in a running fashion and was tied in the middle.  Please note that prior to the fascial closure, the peritoneum was closed using 0 Vicryl in running fashion.  The subcuticular tissue was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition.

CC:, Progressive lower extremity weakness.,HX: ,This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92 ,10/92) chemotherapy.,On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate. She denied any bowel/bladder difficulty.,PMH: ,s/p oral surgery for wisdom tooth extraction.,FHX/SHX: ,1-2 ppd cigarettes. rare ETOH use. Father died of renal CA.,MEDS: ,Decadron 12mg/day.,EXAM: ,Vitals unremarkable.,MS: Unremarkable.,Motor: 5/5 BUE, LE: 4+/5- prox, 5/5 distal to hips.

Plantar responses were down-going bilaterally.,INITIAL IMPRESSION:, Steroid myopathy. Though there was enough of a suspicion of "drop" metastasis that an MRI of the L-spine was obtained.,COURSE:, The MRI L-spine revealed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. No focal mass or cord compression was visualized. CSF examination revealed: 19RBC, 22WBC, 17 Lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, Glucose 56, Protein 150. Cytology (negative). The patient was discharged home on 10/17/92, but experienced worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness and became predominantly wheelchair bound within 4 months. She was last seen on 3/3/93 and showed signs of worsening weakness (left hemiplegia: R > L) as her tumor grew and spread. She then entered a hospice.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: ,1.  Chronic eustachian tube dysfunction.,2.  Retained right pressure equalization tube.,3.  Retracted left tympanic membrane.,4.  Dizziness.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Chronic eustachian tube dysfunction.,2.  Retained right pressure equalization tube.,3.  Retracted left tympanic membrane.,4.  Dizziness.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Removal of the old right pressure equalizing tube with placement of a tube.  Tube used was Santa Barbara.,2.  Myringotomy with placement of a left pressure equalizing tube.  The tube used was Santa Barbara.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION: , This is a 98-year-old female whom I have known for several years.  She has a marginal hearing.  With the additional conductive loss secondary to the retraction of the tympanic membrane, her hearing aid and function deteriorated significantly.  So, we have kept sets of tubes in her ears at all times.  The major problem is that she has got small ear canals and a very sensitive external auditory canal; therefore it cannot tolerate even the wax cleaning in the clinic awake.,The patient was seen in the OR and tubes were placed.  There were no significant findings.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, she was brought to the neurosensory OR, placed under general anesthesia.  Mask airway was used.  IV had already been started.,On the right side, we removed the old tube and then cleaned the cerumen and found that it was larger than the side of the tube in perfection or perforation in tympanic membrane in the anterior inferior quadrant.  In the same area, a small Santa Barbara tube was placed.  This T-tube was cut to 80% of its original length for comfort and then positioned to point straight out and treated.  Three drops of ciprofloxacin eyedrops was placed in the ear canal.,On the left side, the tympanic membrane adhered and it was retracted and has some myringosclerosis.  Anterior, inferior incision was made.  Tympanic membrane bounced back to neutral position.  A Santa Barbara tube was cut to the 80% of the original length and placed in the hole.  Ciprofloxacin drops were placed in the ear.  Procedure completed.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,COMPLICATION: , None.,SPECIMEN:,  None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in a stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Chronic adenotonsillitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal tube.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimum, less than 5 cc.,SPECIMENS:,  Right and left tonsils 2+, adenoid pad 1+.  There was no adenoid specimen.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 9-year-old Caucasian male with history of recurrent episodes of adenotonsillitis that has been refractory to outpatient antibiotic therapy.  The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.  Final look revealed no evidence of further bleeding and 10 mg of Decadron was given intraoperatively.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

C5-C6 arthrodesis, anterior interbody technique.,2.  C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy.,3.  C5-C6 anterior instrumentation with a 23-mm Mystique plate and the 13-mm screws.,4.  Implantation of machine bone implant.,5.  Microsurgical technique.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL.,BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SURGICAL INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old right-handed gentleman who presented with neck and right arm radicular pain.  The pain has become more and more severe.  It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness.  If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm.  If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse.  He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery.  Surgery was discussed with him in detail.  A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended.  He understood and wished to proceed with surgery.  Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR.  There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae.  The neck was slightly extended and taped into position.  A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma.  Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery.  The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath.  The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine.  A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space.  An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure.  A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space.  The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure.  Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible.  Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body.  A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament.  A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina.  A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen.  After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated.  A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate.  So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis.  A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated.  The patient was valsalved.  There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers.  The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin.  The wound was cleaned.,Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins.  Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck.  He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no complications.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left distal both-bone forearm fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left distal both-bone forearm fracture.,PROCEDURE:,  Closed reduction with splint application with use of image intensifier.,INDICATIONS: , Mr. ABC is an 11-year-old boy who sustained a fall on 07/26/2008.  Evaluation in the emergency department revealed both-bone forearm fracture.  Considering the amount of angulation, it was determined that we should proceed with conscious sedation and closed reduction.  After discussion with parents, verbal and written consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was induced with propofol for conscious sedation via the emergency department staff.  After it was confirmed that appropriate sedation had been reached, a longitudinal traction in conjunction with re-creation of the injury maneuver was applied reducing the fracture.  Subsequently, this was confirmed with image intensification, a sugar-tong splint was applied and again reduction was confirmed with image intensifier.  The patient was aroused from anesthesia and tolerated the procedure well.  Post-reduction plain films revealed some anterior displacement of the distal fragment.  At this time, it was determined this fracture proved to be unstable.,DISPOSITION: , After review of the reduction films, it appears that there is some element of fracture causing displacement.  We will proceed to the operating room for open reduction and internal fixation versus closed reduction and percutaneous pinning as our operative schedule allows.,

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Dorsal ganglion, right wrist.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Dorsal ganglion, right wrist.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,  Excision dorsal ganglion, right wrist.,ANESTHESIA:,  Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by surgeon.,TOURNIQUET TIME:,  minutes.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated and the tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg.  A transverse incision was made over the dorsal ganglion.  Using blunt dissection the dorsal ulnar sensory nerve branches and radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The extensor retinaculum was then incised and the extensor tendon was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The ganglion was then further dissected to its origin from the dorsal distal scapholunate interosseus ligament and excised in toto.  Care was taken to protect ligament integrity.  Reactive synovium was then removed using soft tissue rongeur technique.  The wound was then infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The tendons were allowed to resume their normal anatomical position.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Thickened endometrium and tamoxifen therapy.,2.  Adnexal cyst.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Thickened endometrium and tamoxifen therapy.,2.  Adnexal cyst.,3.  Endometrial polyp.,4.  Right ovarian cyst.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Dilation and curettage (D&C).,2.  Hysteroscopy.,3.  Laparoscopy with right salpingooophorectomy and aspiration of cyst fluid.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 20 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 44-year-old gravida 2, para 1-1-1-2 female who was diagnosed with breast cancer in December of 2002.  She has subsequently been on tamoxifen.  Ultrasound did show a thickened endometrial stripe as well as an adnexal cyst.  The above procedures were therefore performed.,FINDINGS:  ,On bimanual exam, the uterus was found to be slightly enlarged and anteverted.  The external genitalia was normal.  Hysteroscopic findings revealed both ostia well visualized and a large polyp on the anterolateral wall of the endometrium.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a normal-appearing uterus and normal left ovary.  There was no evidence of endometriosis on the ovaries bilaterally, the ovarian fossa, the cul-de-sac, or the vesicouterine peritoneum.  There was a cyst on the right ovary which appeared simple in nature.  The cyst was aspirated and the fluid was blood tinged.  Therefore, the decision to perform oophorectomy was made.  The liver margins appeared normal and there were no pelvic or abdominal adhesions noted.  The polyp removed from the hysteroscopic portion of the exam was found to be 4 cm in size.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the posterior vaginal vault in the 12 o'clock position and the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then sounded in the anteverted position to 10 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank and Hegar dilators up to a Hank dilator of 20 and Hagar dilator of 10.  The hysteroscope was then inserted and the above findings were noted.  A sharp curette was then introduced and the 4 cm polyp was removed.  The hysteroscope was then reinserted and the polyp was found to be completely removed at this point.  The polyp was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed as a means to manipulate the uterus.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Using a sterile saline drop test, appropriate placement was confirmed.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume inflow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was placed without difficulty.  The above findings were then visualized.  A 5 mm port was placed 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was done under direct visualization and the grasper was inserted through this port for better visualization.  A 12 mm port was then made in the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and the Endo-GIA was inserted through this port and the fallopian tube and ovary were incorporated across the infundibulopelvic ligament.  Prior to this, the cyst was aspirated using 60 cc syringe on a needle.  Approximately, 20 cc of blood-tinged fluid was obtained.  After the ovary and fallopian tube were completely transected, this was placed in an EndoCatch bag and removed through the lateral port site.  The incision was found to be hemostatic.  The area was suction irrigated.  After adequate inspection, the port sites were removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was desufflated.  The infraumbilical port site and laparoscope were also removed.  The incisions were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then injected locally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will be followed up on an outpatient basis.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.,2.  Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.,PROCEDURE:,  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction.  She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure.  She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.  Excellent aesthetic and functional results were thus obtained and the patient was awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition.

The areas were prepped and draped and localized in the usual manner.  First attention was drawn to the left back.  An elliptical incision was made with a 15-blade scalpel.  The skin ellipse was then grasped with a Bishop forceps and curved Iris scissors were used to dissect the skin ellipse.  After dissection, the skin was undermined.  Radiofrequency cautery was used for hemostasis, and using a 5-0 undyed Vicryl skin was closed in the subcuticular plane and then skin was closed at the level of the skin with 4-0 nylon interrupted suture.,Next, attention was drawn to the mid back.  The skin was incised with a vertical elliptical incision with a 15-blade scalpel and then the mass was grasped with a Bishop forceps and excised with curved Iris scissors.  Afterwards, the skin was approximated using 4-0 nylon interrupted sutures.  Next, attention was drawn to the shoulder lesion.  It was previously marked and a 15-blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision into the skin.,Next, the skin was grasped with a small Bishop forceps and curved Iris scissors were used to dissect the skin ellipse and removed the skin.  The skin was undermined with the curved Iris scissors and then radio frequency treatment was used for hemostasis.,Next, subcuticular plain was closed with 5-0 undyed Vicryl interrupted suture.  Skin was closed with 4-0 nylon suture, interrupted.  Lastly, trichloroacetic acid chemical peel treatment to the left lateral nasal skin was performed.  Please refer to separate operative report for details.  The patient tolerated this procedure very well and we will follow up next week for postoperative re-evaluation or sooner if there are any problems.

Gait: ND,Reflexes: 3/3 BUE, 2/2 BLE. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally.,Gen Exam: unremarkable. No carotid/cranial bruits.,COURSE:, CT Brain showed large, enhancing 4 x 4 x 3 cm suprasellar-sellar mass without surrounding edema. Differential dx: included craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, and aneurysm. MRI Brain findings were consistent with an aneurysm. The patient underwent 3 vessel cerebral angiogram on 12/29/92. This clearly revealed a supraclinoid giant aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Ten minutes following contrast injection the patient became aphasic and developed a right hemiparesis. Emergent HCT showed no evidence of hemorrhage or sign of infarct. Emergent carotid duplex showed no significant stenosis or clot. The patient was left with an expressive aphasia and right hemiparesis. SPECT scans were obtained on 1/7/93 and 2/24/93. They revealed hypoperfusion in the distribution of the left MCA and decreased left basal-ganglia perfusion which may represent in part a mass effect from the LICA aneurysm. She was discharged home and returned and underwent placement of a Selverstone Clamp on 3/9/93. The clamp was gradually and finally closed by 3/14/93. She did well, and returned home. On 3/20/93 she developed sudden confusion associated with worsening of her right hemiparesis and right expressive aphasia. A HCT then showed SAH around her aneurysm, which had thrombosed. She was place on Nimodipine. Her clinical status improved; then on 3/25/93 she rapidly deteriorated over a 2 hour period to the point of lethargy, complete expressive aphasia, and right hemiplegia. An emergent HCT demonstrated a left ACA and left MCA infarction. She required intubation and worsened as cerebral edema developed. She was pronounced brain dead. Her organs were donated for transplant.
INDICATION: , Lung carcinoma.,Whole body PET scanning was performed with 11 mCi of 18 FDG. Axial, coronal and sagittal imaging was performed over the neck, chest abdomen and pelvis.,FINDINGS:,There is normal physiologic activity identified in the myocardium, liver, spleen, ureters, kidneys and bladder.,There is abnormal FDG-avid activity identified in the posterior left paraspinal region best seen on axial images 245-257 with an SUV of 3.8, no definite bone lesion is identified on the CT scan or the bone scan dated 08/14/2007 (It may be purely lytic).,Additionally there is a significant area of activity corresponding to a mass in the region of the left hilum that is visible on the CT scan with an SUV of 18.1, the adjacent atelectasis as likely post obstructive in nature.,Additionally, although there is no definite lesion identified on CT , there is a tiny satellite nodule in the left upper lobe that is hypermetabolic with an SUV of 5.0.

However no lesion is identified on bone scan or CT scan.,There is a hypermetabolic lymph node identified. The aorta pulmonary window with a corresponding finding on CT scan with an SUV of 3.7.
PROCEDURE:,  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Acute cholecystitis.,2.  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,3.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.,5.  Hypertension.,6.  Congestive heart failure.,7.  Skin lymphoma 5 years ago.,8.  Hypothyroidism.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This is a 78-year-old female with past medical condition includes hypertension, end-stage renal disease, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and skin lymphoma who had a left AV fistula done about 3 days ago by Dr. X and the patient went later on home, but started having epigastric pain and right upper quadrant pain and mid abdominal pain, some nauseated feeling, and then she could not handle the pain, so came to the emergency room, brought by the family.  The patient's initial assessment, the patient's vital signs were stable, showed temperature 97.9, pulse was 106, and blood pressure was 156/85.  EKG was not available and ultrasound of the abdomen showed there is a renal cyst about 2 cm.  There is sludge in the gallbladder wall versus a stone in the gallbladder wall.  Thickening of the gallbladder wall with positive Murphy sign.  She has a history of cholecystitis.  Urine shows positive glucose, but negative for nitrite and creatinine was 7.1, sodium 131, potassium was 5.2, and lipase and amylase were normal.  So, the patient admitted to the Med/Surg floor initially and the patient was started on IV fluid as well as low-dose IV antibiotic and 2-D echocardiogram and EKG also was ordered.  The patient also had history of CHF in the past and recently had some workup done.  The patient does not remember initially.  Surgical consult also requested and blood culture and urine culture also ordered.  The same day, the patient was seen by Dr. Y and the patient should need cholecystectomy, but the patient also needs dialysis and also needs to be cleared by the cardiologist, so the patient later on seen by Dr. Z and cleared the patient for the surgery with moderate risk and the patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  The patient also seen by nephrologist and underwent dialysis.  The patient's white count went down 6.1, afebrile.  On postop day #1, the patient started eating and also walking.  The patient also had chronic bronchitis.  The patient was later on feeling fine, discussed with surgery.  The patient was then able to discharge to home and follow with the surgeon in about 3-5 days.  Discharged home with Synthroid 0.5 mg 1 tablet p.o. daily, Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, folic acid 1 mg p.o. daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily, Renagel 2 tablets 800 mg p.o. twice a day, Lasix 40 mg p.o.  2 tablets twice a day, lovastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day, nebulizer therapy every 3 hours as needed, also Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.8 hours for nausea and vomiting, Pepcid 20 mg p.o. daily, Vicodin 1 tablet p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n. as needed, and Levaquin 250 mg p.o. every other day for the next 5 days.  The patient also had Premarin that she was taking, advised to discontinue because of increased risk of heart disease and stroke explained to the patient.  Discharged home.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Low Back Syndrome - Low back pain with left greater than right lower extremity radiculopathy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Nerve root decompression at L45 on the left side.,2.  Tun-L catheter placement with injection of steroid solution and Marcaine at L45 nerve roots left.,3.  Interpretation of radiograph.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.
PROCEDURE:,  A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram was performed on a patient in the awake state.  Per the technician's notes, the patient is taking Depakene.,The recording consists of symmetric 9 Hz alpha activity.  Throughout the recording, repetitive episodes of bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity are noted.  The episodes last from approximately1 to 7 seconds.  The episodes are exacerbated by hyperventilation.,IMPRESSION:,  Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation.  This activity could represent true petit mal epilepsy.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
NUCLEAR MEDICINE HEPATOBILIARY SCAN,REASON FOR EXAM: , Right upper quadrant pain.,COMPARISONS:  ,CT of the abdomen dated 02/13/09 and ultrasound of the abdomen dated 02/13/09.,Radiopharmaceutical 6.9 mCi of Technetium-99m Choletec.,FINDINGS:,  Imaging obtained up to 30 minutes after the injection of radiopharmaceutical shows a normal hepatobiliary transfer time.  There is normal accumulation within the gallbladder.,After the injection of 2.1 mcg of intravenous cholecystic _______, the gallbladder ejection fraction at 30 minutes was calculated to be 32% (normal is greater than 35%).  The patient experienced 2/10 pain at 5 minutes after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical and the patient also complained of nausea.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Negative for acute cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction.,2.  Gallbladder ejection fraction just under the lower limits of normal at 32% that can be seen with very mild chronic cholecystitis.
The patient underwent an overnight polysomnogram on 09/22/06 and the details of the polysomnographic study are reported separately.  The highlights of the study include the following:,A.  Obstructive apneas and hypopneas were identified with an overall apnea-hypopnea index of 15.2 events per hour in the supine position.  All events occurred in the supine position and were more prominent during stage REM sleep.  Minimum oxygen saturation was 88%.,B.  Periodic limb movements in sleep were identified with an overall index of 32 events per hour of sleep.,C.  The patient's sleep efficiency was reduced to 89.2%.  There was significant sleep fragmentation due to the obstructive apneas and hypopneas as well as due to the periodic limb movements in sleep disorder.  The patient did not achieve any stage III/IV sleep and stage REM sleep was diminished at 12.7%.  There was a corresponding increase in stage I sleep and stage II sleep at 10.8% and 65.7% respectively.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,1.  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, supine position dependent, moderate (780.53-0).,2.  Periodic limb movement in sleep disorder, moderate (780.53-4).,CASE DISCUSSION: , Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in the care of the patient here at the Sleep Clinic.,The patient exhibits obstructive sleep apnea, a condition associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death.  Furthermore, patients with this condition are susceptible to excessive daytime sleepiness while driving and there is a higher incidence of automobile accident.  The patient should be warned with regards to these possibilities.,Patients with this condition can be successfully treated with nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), so that the patient should return to the sleep laboratory for repeat overnight polysomnogram with CPAP titration.  The sleep laboratory if necessary can introduce the patient to the proper use of the CPAP equipment and to determine a necessary pressure to prevent apneas.,It is reported that the patient undergo careful ENT/maxillofacial evaluation by a physician familiar with sleep disorders.  Anatomical abnormalities in the upper airway often cause or predispose to this condition.  Surgical intervention may be helpful or necessary if such conditions exist.  Alternatively, ________ may be of benefit in some patients depending upon the anatomical abnormalities.,Obstructive sleep apnea is worsened by obesity.  The patient should be encouraged to lose weight.  Patients usually lose weight more effectively when involved in a behavioral weight loss program.  It is sometimes difficult for patients to lose weight until the OSA is adequately treated because excessive daytime sleepiness results in decreased physical activity in the daytime.,Patient may have worsening obstructive sleep apnea by nasal airway obstruction and nasal congestion.  If present, these conditions should be treated.  In addition, any home allergens such as pets, down bedding or other factors should be removed from the sleep environment.,The patient should be informed that obstructive sleep apnea may be worsened by the use of alcohol or sedative medications particularly taken in the evening.  Therefore, the evening use of sedative medications and alcohol are to be avoided.,The patient also exhibits periodic limb movements in sleep disorder.  This may require treatment.  However, it will be appropriate to obtain the repeat overnight polysomnogram with CPAP titration to see if the PLMS continues to be troublesome.  If so, treatment recommendations will be made.
FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY,The flexible bronchoscopy is performed under conscious sedation in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.  I explained to the parents that the possible risks include:  irritation of the nasal mucosa, which can be associated with some bleeding; risk of contamination of the lower airways by passage of the scope in the nasopharynx; respiratory depression from sedation; and a very small risk of pneumothorax.  A bronchoalveolar lavage may be obtained by injecting normal saline in one of the bronchi and suctioning the fluid back.  The sample will then be sent for testing.  The flexible bronchoscopy is mainly diagnostic, any therapeutic intervention, if deemed necessary, will be planned and will require a separate procedure.,The parents seem to understand, had the opportunity to ask questions and were satisfied with the information.  A booklet containing the description of the procedure and other information was provided.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , This is a previously healthy 45-year-old gentleman.  For the past 3 years, he has had some intermittent episodes of severe nausea and abdominal pain.  On the morning of this admission, he had the onset of severe pain with nausea and vomiting and was seen in the emergency department, where Dr. XYZ noted an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  He was able to reduce this, with relief of pain.  He is now being admitted for definitive repair.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant only for hemorrhoidectomy.  He does have a history of depression and hypertension.,MEDICATIONS: , His only medications are Ziac and Remeron.,ALLERGIES:,  No allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative for cancer.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is single.  He has 2 children.  He drinks 4-8 beers per night and smokes half a pack per day for 30 years.  He was born in Salt Lake City.  He works in an electronic assembly for Harmony Music.  He has no history of hepatitis or blood transfusions.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Examination shows a moderate to markedly obese gentleman in mild distress since his initial presentation to the emergency department.,HEENT:  No scleral icterus.,NECK:  No cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary adenopathy.,LUNGS:  Clear.,HEART:  Regular.  No murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  As noted, obese with mildly visible bulging in the umbilicus at the superior position.  With gentle traction, we were able to feel both herniated contents, which when reduced, reveals an approximately 2-cm palpable defect in the umbilicus.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  ,Normal sinus rhythm on EKG, prolonged QT.  Chest x-ray was negative.  The abdominal x-rays were read as being negative.  His electrolytes were normal.  Creatinine was 0.9.  White count was 6.5, hematocrit was 48, and platelet count was 307.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  Otherwise previously healthy gentleman, who presents with an incarcerated umbilical hernia, now for repair with mesh.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Chronic otitis media with effusion, conductive hearing loss, and recurrent acute otitis media.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Chronic otitis media with effusion, conductive hearing loss, and recurrent acute otitis media.,OPERATION: , Bilateral myringotomies, insertion of PE tubes, and pharyngeal anesthesia.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General via facemask.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a one-year-old with history of chronic and recurrent episodes of otitis media with persistent middle ear effusions resistant to medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, was placed in supine position.  General anesthesia was begun via face mask technique.  Once an adequate level of anesthesia was obtained, the operating microscope was brought, positioned and visualized the right ear canal.  A small amount of wax was removed with a loop.  A 4-mm operating speculum was then introduced.  An anteroinferior quadrant radial myringotomy was then performed.  A large amount of mucoid middle ear effusion was aspirated from the middle ear cleft.  Reuter bobbin PE tube was then inserted, followed by Floxin otic drops and a cotton ball in the external meatus.  Head was then turned to the opposite side, where similar procedure was performed.  Once again, the middle ear cleft had a mucoid effusion.  A tube was inserted to an anteroinferior quadrant radial myringotomy.,Anesthesia was then reversed and the patient was transported to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well with stable signs.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Wrist ganglion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Wrist ganglion.,TITLE OF PROCEDURE: , Excision of dorsal wrist ganglion.,PROCEDURE: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and general anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  I made a transverse incision directly over the ganglion.  Dissection was carried down through the extensor retinaculum, identifying the 3rd and the 4th compartments and retracting them.  I then excised the ganglion and its stalk.  In addition, approximately a square centimeter of the dorsal capsule was removed at the origin of stalk, leaving enough of a defect to prevent formation of a one-way valve.  We then identified the scapholunate ligament, which was uninjured.  I irrigated and closed in layers and injected Marcaine with epinephrine.  I dressed and splinted the wound.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.
HISTORY:,  A is a 55-year-old who I know well because I have been taking care of her husband.  She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy.  Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal.  Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy.  I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so.  She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain.  She has had no hematochezia.  She denies any melena.  She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history.  Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says.  She does not know exactly what was done.  It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists.  This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done.  She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital.  Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses.  She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says.,MEDICATIONS: , Reglan 10 mg once a day.,ALLERGIES: , She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day.  She was counseled to quit.  She occasionally uses alcohol.  She has never used illicit drugs.  She is married, is a housewife, and has four children.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Positive for diabetes and cancer.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Essentially as mentioned above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  A is a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Her vital signs reveal a weight of 164 pounds, blood pressure 140/90, temperature of 97.6 degrees F.,HEENT:  No cervical bruits, thyromegaly, or masses.  She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.,EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally.,NEURO:  No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four.,ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: , In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy.  We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers.  She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well.  I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed.,We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience.
REFERRAL INDICATION,1.  Tachybrady syndrome.,2.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.,PROCEDURES PLANNED AND PERFORMED,1.  Implantation of a single-chamber pacemaker.,2.  Fluoroscopic guidance for implantation of single-chamber pacemaker.,FLUOROSCOPY TIME:  ,1.2 minutes.,MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF STUDY,1.  Ancef 1 g.,2.  Benadryl 50 mg.,3.  Versed 3 mg.,4.  Fentanyl 150 mcg.,CLINICAL HISTORY: , The patient is a pleasant 73-year-old female with chronic atrial fibrillation.  She has been found to have tachybrady syndrome, has been referred for pacemaker implantation.,RISKS AND BENEFITS: , Risks, benefits, and alternatives of implantation of a single-chamber pacemaker were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.  Risks that were discussed included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  Percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was then performed.  A wire was then advanced in the left axillary vein using fluoroscopy.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was then administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the previously placed guidewire, a 7-French sidearm sheath was advanced over the wire into the vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down in the right atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Lead was passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in an apical septal location.  This was an active fixed lead and the screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  The suture sleeve was then advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  A pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the lead.  The lead was then carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator, and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  Pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  No acute complications were noted.,DEVICE DATA,1.  Pulse generator, manufacturer St. Jude model 12345, serial #123456.,2.  Right ventricular lead, manufacturer St. Jude model 12345, serial #ABCD123456.,MEASURED INTRAOPERATIVE DATA:,  Right ventricular lead impedance 630 ohms.  R wave measures 17.5 mV.

No acute complications.,PLAN,1.  The patient will be admitted for overnight observation and dismissed at the discretion of primary service.,2.  Chest x-ray to rule out pneumothorax and verify lead position.,3.  Completion of course of antibiotics.,4.  Device interrogation in the morning.,5.  Home dismissal instructions provided in a written format.,6.  Wound check in 7 to 10 days.,7.  Enrollment in Device Clinic.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Left hip cemented hemiarthroplasty.,2.  Biopsy of the tissue from the fracture site and resected femoral head sent to the pathology for further assessment.,IMPLANTS USED:,1.  DePuy Ultima calcar stem, size 3 x 45.,2.  Bipolar head 28 x 43.,3.  Head with +0 neck length.,4.  Distal centralizer and cement restrictor.,5.  SmartSet antibiotic cement x2.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,NEEDLE AND SPONGE COUNT: , Correct.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 300 mL.,SPECIMEN: , Resected femoral head and tissue from the fracture site as well as the marrow from the canal.,FINDINGS:  ,On exposure, the fracture was noted to be basicervical pattern with no presence of calcar about the lesser trochanter.  The lesser trochanter was intact.  The fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration.  The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone.  The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment.  Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture.  She denied any history of fall or trauma.  The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment.  Indication, risks, and benefits were discussed.  Treatment options were reviewed.  No guarantees have been made or implied.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Time-out procedure was called.  Antibiotics were infused.,A standard posterolateral approach was made.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus.  This was then incised along the line of the incision.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Charnley retractor was positioned.  The trochanter was intact.  The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor.  The piriformis and minimus junction was identified.  The minimus was also reflected along with the medius.  Using Bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion.  Similarly, L-shaped capsulotomy was performed.  A #5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair.  Fracture site was exposed.  The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low-lying basicervical type.  Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew.  The head size was measured to be 43 mm.  Bony fragments were removed.  The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated.  A 43-mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability.  The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration.  This was sent to the pathology.  The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem.  An L-shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis.  The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter.  There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter.  The L-shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder.  The fracture site was well exposed.  Satisfactory lateralization was performed.  Attention was for the reaming process.  Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal.  At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted.  Appropriate anteversion was positioned.  The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation.  The bony edges were trimmed.  The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well.  There was no evidence of any subsidence.  At this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length.  The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory.  The hip was well reduced without any difficulty.  The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory.  The shuck was less than 1 mm.  Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg.  Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75-80 degrees of internal rotation.  Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees.  After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed.  The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely.  At this point, 2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed.  The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected.  Centralizer was positioned.  The cement restrictor was inserted.  Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried.  Using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed.  The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured.  The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator.  All the cement debris was removed.,Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head.  Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion.  It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory.  I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal.  The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation.  There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation.  I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable.  At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced.  Range of motion and stability was as above.  Now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis.  This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster.  Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the #5 Ethibond.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2-0 Vicryl.  The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures.  Skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed.  Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.
OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hematochezia.,2.  Refractory dyspepsia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm.,2.  Diverticulosis coli.,2.  Acute and chronic gastritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Colonoscopy to cecum with snare polypectomy.,2.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURES:  ,This is a 43-year-old white male who presents as an outpatient to the General Surgery Service with hematochezia with no explainable source at the anal verge.  He also had refractory dyspepsia despite b.i.d., Nexium therapy.  The patient does use alcohol and tobacco.  The patient gave informed consent for the procedure.,GROSS FINDINGS: , At the time of colonoscopy, the entire length of colon was visualized.  The patient was found to have a sigmoid diverticulosis.  He also was found to have some colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm.  The polyps were large enough to be treated with snare cautery technique.  The polyps were achieved and submitted to pathology.  EGD did confirm acute and chronic gastritis.  The biopsies were performed for H&E and CLO testing.  The patient had no evidence of distal esophagitis or ulcers.  No mass lesions were seen.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite with the heart and lungs examination unremarkable.  The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral position where intravenous Demerol and Versed were given in a titrated fashion.,The video Olympus colonoscope was advanced per anus and without difficulty to the level of cecum.  Photographic documentation of the diverticulosis and polyps were obtained.  The patient's polyps were removed in a similar fashion, each removed with snare cautery.  The polyps were encircled at their stalk.  Increasing the tension and cautery was applied as coagulation and cutting blunt mode, 15/15 was utilized.  Good blanching was seen.  The polyp was retrieved with the suction port of the scope.  The patient was re-scoped to the polyp levels to confirm that there was no evidence of perforation or bleeding at the polypectomy site.  Diverticulosis coli was also noted.  With colonoscopy completed, the patient was then turned for EGD.  The oropharynx was previously anesthetized with Cetacaine spray and a biteblock was placed.  Video Olympus GIF gastroscope model was inserted per os and advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx.  The esophagus revealed a GE junction at 39 cm.  The GE junction was grossly within normal limits.  The stomach was entered and distended with air.  Acute and chronic gastritis features as stated were appreciated.  The pylorus was traversed with normal duodenum.  The stomach was again reentered.  Retroflex maneuver of the scope confirmed that there was no evidence of hiatal hernia.  There were no ulcers or mass lesions seen.  The patient had biopsy performed of the antrum for H&E and CLO testing.  There was no evidence of untoward bleeding at biopsy sites.  Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope.  The patient will be placed on a reflux diet, given instruction and information on Nexium usage.  Additional recommendations will follow pending biopsy results.  He is to also abstain from alcohol and tobacco.  He will require follow-up colonoscopy again in three years for polyp disease.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Prior history of neoplastic polyps.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Small rectal polyps/removed and fulgurated.,PREMEDICATIONS:,  Prior to the colonoscopy, the patient complained of a sever headache and she was concerned that she might become ill.  I asked the nurse to give her 25 mg of Demerol IV.,Following the IV Demerol, she had a nausea reaction.  She was then given 25 mg of Phenergan IV.  Following this, her headache and nausea completely resolved.  She was then given a total of 7.5 mg of Versed with adequate sedation.  Rectal exam revealed no external lesions.  Digital exam revealed no mass.,REPORTED PROCEDURE:,  The P160 colonoscope was used.  The scope was placed in the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum.  Navigation through the sigmoid colon was difficult.  Beginning at 30 cm was a very tight bend.  With gentle maneuvering, the scope passed through and then entered the cecum.  The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon were normal.  The sigmoid colon was likewise normal.  There were five very small (punctate) polyps in the rectum.  One was resected using the electrocautery snare and the other four were ablated using the snare and cautery.  There was no specimen because the polyps were so small.  The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no further abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.,ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:,1.  Five small polyps as described, all fulgurated.,2.  Otherwise unremarkable colonoscopy.
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: , Cardiac arrhythmia.,INTERPRETATION: , No significant pericardial effusion was identified.,The aortic root dimensions are within normal limits.  The four cardiac chambers dimensions are within normal limits.  No discrete regional wall motion abnormalities are identified.  The left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.  The left ventricular wall thickness is within normal limits.,The aortic valve is trileaflet with adequate excursion of the leaflets.  The mitral valve and tricuspid valve motion is unremarkable.  The pulmonic valve is not well visualized.,Color flow and conventional Doppler interrogation of cardiac valvular structures revealed mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation with an RV systolic pressure calculated to be 28 mmHg.  Doppler interrogation of the mitral in-flow pattern is within normal limits for age.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Preserved left ventricular systolic function.,2.  Mild mitral regurgitation.,3.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low back pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low back pain.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Lumbar discogram L2-3.,2.  Lumbar discogram L3-4.,3.  Lumbar discogram L4-5.,4.  Lumbar discogram L5-S1.,ANESTHESIA:  ,IV sedation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Radiology Suite and placed prone onto a radiolucent table.  The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained.  We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.,A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral open mandible fracture, open left angle and open symphysis fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral open mandible fracture, open left angle and open symphysis fracture.,PROCEDURE:  ,Closed reduction of mandible fracture with MMF.,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia via nasal endotracheal intubation.,FLUIDS: , 2 L of crystalloid.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,HARDWARE: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,CONDITION:  ,The patient was extubated to PACU in good condition.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 17-year-old female who is 2 days status post an altercation in which she sustained multiple blows to the face.  She was worked up on Friday night, 2 days earlier at Hospital, was given palliative treatment and discharged and instructed to follow up as an outpatient with an oral surgeon and given a phone number to call.  The patient was worked up initially.  On initial exam, it was noted that the patient had a left V3 paresthesia.  She had a gross malocclusion.  On the facial CT and panoramic x-ray, it was noted to be a displaced left angle fracture and nondisplaced symphysis fracture.  Alternatives were discussed with the patient and it was determined she would benefit from being taken to the operating room under general anesthesia to have a closed reduction of her fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained with the patient's mother.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room #4 at Hospital and laid in a supine position on the operating room table.  Monitor was attached and general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetics and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inhalation anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oromaxillofacial surgery fashion.,Surgeon approached the operating table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  A moistened Ray-Tec sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx and the mouth was prepped with Peridex mouthrinse, scrubbed with a toothbrush.  The Peridex was evacuated with Yankauer suction.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla from the first molar to the contralateral first molar and secured with 24-gauge surgical steel wire on the posterior teeth and 26-gauge surgical steel wire on the anterior teeth.  Same was done on the mandible.  The patient was then manipulated up in the maximum intercuspation and noted to be reproducible.  The throat pack was then removed.,The patient was remanipulated up to the maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics.  At this point in time, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea.,OPERATION PERFORMED,Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY,The patient is a 50-year-old white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the National Tennessee, and several years ago he had a tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement.  However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.

A 1 cm x 1 cm actinic keratosis of the right mid cheek.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Enlarging skin neoplasm, actinic neoplasm, left upper cheek, measures 1 cm x 1.5 cm.,2.  Enlarging 0.5 cm x 1 cm nevus of the left lower cheek neck region.,3.  A 1 cm x 1 cm seborrheic keratosis of the mid neck.,4.  A 1 cm x 1.5 cm verrucous seborrheic keratosis of the right auricular rim.,5.  A 1 cm x 1 cm actinic keratosis of the right mid cheek.,TITLE OF PROCEDURES:,1.  Excision of the left upper cheek actinic neoplasm defect measuring 1.5 cm x 1.8 cm with two-layer plastic closure.,2.  Excision of the left lower cheek upper neck, 1 cm x 1.5 cm skin neoplasm with two-layer plastic closure.,3.  Shave excision of the mid neck seborrheic keratosis that measured 1 cm x 1.5 cm.,4.  Shave excision of the right superior pinna auricular rim, 1 cm x 1.5 cm verrucous keratotic neoplasm.,5.  A 50% trichloroacetic acid treatment of the right mid cheek, 1 cm x 1 cm actinic neoplasm.,ANESTHESIA: , Local.  I used a total of 6 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 30 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,COUNTS:  ,Sponge and needle counts were all correct.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was evaluated preop and noted to be in stable condition.  Chart and informed consent were all reviewed preop.  All risks, benefits, and alternatives regarding the procedure have been reviewed in detail with the patient.  She is aware of risks include but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, recurrence of the lesion, need for further procedures, etc.  The areas of concern were marked with the marking pen.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated.  Sterile prep and drape were then performed.,I began excising the left upper cheek and left lower cheek neck lesions as listed above.  These were excised with the #15 blade.  The left upper cheek lesion measures 1 cm x 1.5 cm, defect after excision is 1.5 cm x 1.8 cm.  A suture was placed at the 12 o'clock superior margin.  Clinically, this appears to be either actinic keratosis or possible basal cell carcinoma.  The healthy margin of healthy tissue around this lesion was removed.  Wide underminings were performed and the lesion was closed in a two-layered fashion using 5-0 myochromic for the deep subcutaneous and 5-0 nylon for the skin.,The left upper neck lesion was also removed in the similar manner.  This is dark and black, appears to be either an intradermal nevus or pigmented seborrheic keratosis.  It was excised using a #15 blade down the subcutaneous tissue with the defect 1 cm x 1.5 cm.  After wide underminings were performed, a two-layer plastic closure was performed with 5-0 myochromic for the deep subcutaneous and 5-0 nylon for the skin.,The lesion of the mid neck and the auricular rim were then shave excised for the upper dermal layer with the Ellman radiofrequency wave unit.  These appeared to be clinically seborrheic keratotic neoplasms.,Finally proceeded with the right cheek lesion, which was treated with the 50% TCA.  This was also an actinic keratosis.  It is new in onset, just within the last week.  Once a light frosting was obtained from the treatment site, bacitracin ointment was applied.  Postop care instructions have been reviewed in detail.  The patient is scheduled a recheck in one week for suture removal.  We will make further recommendations at that time.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Status epilepticus.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 6-year-old male who is a former 27-week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement, and as a result, has developmental delay and left hemiparesis.  At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  There is no numbness or loss of skills.  He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.  He has no oropharyngeal complaints.  Visual or auditory complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Also positive for some mild scoliosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings.  There are no ill contacts.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male, in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  His vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile.,HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.,ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and will follow instructions.  His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  He is about 50% understandable at best.  He does put words and sentences together.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.

A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.  Given the magnitude of the operation, the unavailability of an appropriate level, cardiac surgical resident, Mrs. X (attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the Hospital) participated during the cross-clamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 41-year-old white male with a history of HIV disease.  His last CD4 count was 425, viral load was less than 50 in 08/07.  He was recently hospitalized for left gluteal abscess, for which he underwent I&D and he has newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus.  He also has a history of hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia.  He had been having increased urination and thirst.  He was seen in the hospital by the endocrinology staff and treated with insulin while hospitalized and getting treatment for his perirectal abscess.  The endocrine team apparently felt that insulin might be best for this patient, but because of financial issues, elected to place him on Glucophage and glyburide.  The patient reports that he has been taking the medication.  He is in general feeling better.  He says that his gluteal abscess is improving and he will be following up with Surgery today.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Gabapentin 600 mg at night.,2.  Metformin 1000 mg twice a day.,3.

At this point, no changes in her medication were prescribed until her followup visit.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute cholecystitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute gangrenous cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.,FINDINGS:  ,The patient had essentially a dead gallbladder with stones and positive wide bile/pus coming from the gallbladder.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,EBL: , Scant.,SPECIMEN REMOVED: , Gallbladder with stones.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion under general anesthesia.  A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus.  Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization.  Once this complete, insufflation was begun.  Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant.  Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored.  The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis.  This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall.  Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area.  Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction.  At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected.  The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder.  Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved.  The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port.  A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture.  Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator.  Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed.  The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion.  All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain.  The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. ,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,  Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. ,PROCEDURE: ,  Exploratory laparotomy and drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with control of leakage. ,COMPLICATIONS:,  None. ,ANESTHESIA: , General oroendotracheal intubation. ,PROCEDURE:  , After adequate general anesthesia was administered, the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications.

CC:, Progressive memory and cognitive decline.,HX:, This 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94.,Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play "Murder She Wrote" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the "assassin." Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a "chuckle.",While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing "Murder She Wrote." She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time.,She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back.,Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was "Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.",One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.,MEDS:, None.,PMH:, Unremarkable.,FHX:, Father and mother died in their 80's of "old age." There was no history of dementing illness, stroke, HTN, DM, or other neurological disease in her family. She has 5 children who were alive and well.,SHX: ,She attained a High School education and had been widowed for over 30 years. She lived alone for 15 years until to 12/94, when her daughters began sharing the task of caring for her. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drug use.,EXAM:, Vitals signs were within normal limits.,MS: A&O to person place and time. At times she seemed in absence. She scored 20/30 on MMSE and had difficulty with concentration, calculation, visuospatial construction. Her penmanship was not normal, and appeared "child-like" according to her daughters. She had difficulty writing a sentence and spoke in a halting fashion; she appeared to have difficulty finding words. In addition, while attempting to write, she had difficulty finding the right margin of the page.,CN: Right homonymous inferior quadrantanopsia bordering on a right homonymous hemianopsia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.,Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk.,Sensory: extinguishing of RUE sensation on double simultaneous stimulation, and at times she appeared to show sign of RUE neglect. There were no unusual spontaneous movements noted.,Coord: unremarkable except for difficulty finding the target on FNF exercise when the target was moved into the right side visual field.,Station: No sign of Romberg or pronator drift. There was no truncal ataxia.,Gait: decreased RUE swing and a tendency to veer and circumambulate to the right when asked to walk toward a target.,Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally.,COURSE:,  CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, UA, CRP, TSH, FT4, and EKG were unremarkable. CSF analysis revealed: 38 RBC, 0 WBC, Protein 36, glucose 76. The outside MRI was reviewed and was found to show increased signal on T2 weighted images in the gyri of the left parietal-occipital regions. Repeat MRI, at UIHC, revealed the same plus increased signal on T2 weighted images in the left frontal region as well. CXR, transthoracic echocardiogram and 4 vessel cerebral angiogram were unremarkable. A 1/23/95, left frontal brain biopsy revealed spongiform changes without sign of focal necrosis, vasculitis or inflammatory changes. The working diagnosis became Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Heidenhaim variant). The patient died on 2/15/95. Brain tissue was sent to the University of California at San Francisco. Analysis there revealed diffuse vacuolization throughout most of the cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla. This vacuolization was most severe in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. Hydrolytic autoclaving technique was used with PrP-specific antibodies to identify the presence of protease resistant PrP (CJD). The patient's brain tissue was strongly positive for PrP (CJD).
CC: ,Motor vehicle-bicycle collision.,HX:, A 5 y/o boy admitted 10/17/92. He was struck while riding his bicycle by a motor vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. First responders found him unconscious with left pupil 6 mm and unreactive and the right pupil 3 mm and reactive. He had bilateral decorticate posturing and was bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth. He was intubated and ventilated in the field, and then transferred to UIHC.,PMH/FHX/SHX:, unremarkable.,MEDS:, none,EXAM:, BP 127/91 HR69 RR30,MS: unconscious and intubated,Glasgow coma scale=4,CN: Pupils 6/6 fixed.

Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Right ventricular collection of blood. Right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Significant mass effect with deviation of the midline structures to right. The left ventricle was compressed with obliteration of the suprasellar cistern. Air within the soft tissues in the left infra temporal region. C-spine XR, Abdominal/Chest CT were unremarkable.,Patient was taken to the OR emergently and underwent bifrontal craniotomy, evacuation of a small epidural and subdural hematomas, and duraplasty. He was given mannitol enroute to the OR and hyperventilated during and after the procedure. Postoperatively he continued to manifest decerebrate posturing . On 11/16/92 he underwent VP shunting with little subsequent change in his neurological status. On 11/23/92 he underwent tracheostomy. On 12/11/92 he underwent bifrontal acrylic prosthesis implantation for repair of the bifrontal craniectomy. By the time of discharge, 1/14/93, he tracked relatively well OD, but had a CN3 palsy OS. He had relatively severe extensor rigidity in all extremities (R>L). His tracheotomy was closed prior to discharge. A 11/16/92 Brain MRI demonstrated infarction in the upper brain stem (particularly in the Pons), left cerebellum, right basil ganglia and thalamus.,He was initially treated for seizure prophylaxis with DPH, but developed neutropenia, so it was discontinued. He developed seizures within several months of discharge and was placed on VPA (Depakene). This decreased seizure frequency but his liver enzymes became elevated and he changed over to Tegretol. 10/8/93 Brain MRI (one year after MVA) revealed interval appearance of hydrocephalus, abnormal increased T2 signal (in the medulla, right pons, both basal ganglia, right frontal and left occipital regions), a small mid-brain, and a right subdural fluid collection. These findings were consistent with diffuse axonal injury of the white matter and gray matter contusion, and signs of a previous right subdural hematoma.,He was last seen 10/30/96 in the pediatric neurology clinic--age 9 years. He was averaging 2-3 seizures per day---characterized by extension of BUE with tremor and audible cry or laughter---on Tegretol and Diazepam. In addition he experiences 24-48hour periods of "startle response (myoclonic movement of the shoulders)" with or without stimulation every 6 weeks. He had limited communication skills (sparse speech). On exam he had disconjugate gaze, dilated/fixed left pupil, spastic quadriplegia.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 47-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain in September 2006.  On chest x-ray, she had a possible infiltrate and it was thought she might have pneumonia and she was treated with antibiotics and prednisone.  Symptoms improved temporarily, but did not completely resolve.  By the end of September, her pain had worsened and she was seen in the emergency room at ABC.  Chest x-ray was compatible with pleurisy and she was treated with Percocet.  Few days later, she was seen and given a prescription for Ultram because Percocet was causing nausea.  Eventually, she was seen by Dr. X and noted to have splenomegaly.  Repeat ultrasound was done and showed the spleen enlarged at 19 cm.  In retrospect, this was not changed in comparison to an ultrasound that was done in September.  She underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, which showed diffuse hypermetabolic lymph nodes measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter, as well as a hypermetabolic spleen that was enlarged.,The patient underwent lymph node biopsy on the right neck on 10/27/2006.

Toxicities have already been discussed with her including myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, the low risk for cardiac toxicity, bladder toxicity, neuropathy, constipation, etc.  Written materials were provided to her last week.,PLAN: , Plan will be to add Rituxan a little later in her course because she has circulating lymphoma cells.  She will be started on allopurinol today as well as hydration further to avoid the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome.,Plan will be to have her evaluated for bone marrow transplant in first remission.  I will have Dr. Y see her while she is in the hospital.,The patient is anxious, and will be given Ativan as needed.  We will discontinue aspirin for now, but continue estradiol/Prometrium.,Iron deficiency will be treated with oral iron supplements and we will follow her counts.  She may well have gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, which is not uncommon with mantle cell lymphoma.  After she undergoes remission, we will consider colonoscopy for biopsies prior to proceeding to transplant.

With each stage, a thin layer of tumor-laden tissue was excised with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin, using the Mohs fresh tissue technique.  A map was prepared to correspond to the area of skin from which it was excised.  The tissue was prepared for the cryostat and sectioned.  Each section was coded, cut and stained for microscopic examination.  The entire base and margins of the excised piece of tissue were examined by the surgeon.  Areas noted to be positive on the previous stage (if applicable) were removed with the Mohs technique and processed for analysis.,No tumor was identified after the final stage of microscopically controlled surgery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complication.  After discussion with the patient regarding the various options, the best closure option for each defect was selected for optimal functional and cosmetic results.

MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Strokes.,SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY DIAGNOSIS:  ,Global aphasia.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient is a 44-year-old female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often "no."  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded "no" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered "no" to all "yes/no" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated "I can't".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple "yes/no" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Oropharyngeal foreign body.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Foreign body, left vallecula at the base of the tongue.,2.  Airway is patent and stable.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Flexible nasal laryngoscopy.,ANESTHESIA:,  ______ with viscous lidocaine nasal spray.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 39-year-old Caucasian male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with acute onset of odynophagia and globus sensation.  The patient stated his symptoms began around mid night after returning home _________ ingesting some chicken.  The patient felt that he had ingested a chicken bone, tried to dislodge this with fluids and other solid foods as well as sticking his finger down his throat without success.  The patient subsequently was seen in the Emergency Department where it was discovered that the patient had a left vallecular foreign body.  Department of Otolaryngology was asked to consult for further evaluation and treatment of this foreign body.,PROCEDURE: , After verbal informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the upright position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was inserted in the patient's right naris and then the left naris.  There was visualized some bilateral caudal spurring of the septum.  The turbinates were within normal limits.  There was some posterior nasoseptal deviation to the left.  The nasal laryngoscope was then inserted back into the right naris and it was advanced along the floor of the nasal cavity.  The nasal mucous membranes were pink and moist.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.,The scope was further advanced to the level of the nasopharynx where the eustachian tubes were visualized bilaterally.  There was evidence of some mild erythema in the right fossa Rosenmller.  There was no evidence of mass lesion or ulceration in this area, however.  The eustachian tubes were patent without obstruction.  The scope was further advanced to the level of the oropharynx where the base of the tongue, vallecula, and epiglottis were visualized.  There was evidence of a 1.5 cm left vallecular white foreign body.  The rest of the oropharynx was without abnormality.  The epiglottis was within normal limits and was noted to be omega in shape.  There was no edema or erythema to the epiglottis.  The scope was then further advanced to the level of the hypopharynx to the level of the true vocal cords.  There was no evidence of erythema or edema of the posterior commissure, arytenoid cartilage, or superior surface of the vocal cords.  The laryngeal surface of the epiglottis was within normal limits.  There was no evidence of mass lesion or nodularity of the vocal cords.  The patient was asked to Valsalva and the piriform sinuses were observed without evidence of foreign body or mass lesion.  The patient did have complete glottic closure upon phonation and the airway was patent and stable throughout the exam.  The glottic aperture was completely patent with inspiration.  The anterior commissure, epiglottic folds, false vocal cords, and piriform sinuses were all within normal limits.  The scope was then removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.,FINDINGS:,1.  A 1.5 cm white foreign body consistent with a chicken bone at the left vallecular region.  There is no evidence of supraglottic or piriform sinuses foreign body.,2.  Mild erythema of the right nasopharynx in the region of the fossa Rosenmller.  No mass is appreciated at this time.,PLAN:,  The patient is to go to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy/microscopic suspension direct laryngoscopy for removal of foreign body under anesthesia this a.m.  Airway precautions were instituted.  The patient currently remained in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS:,1.  Versed intravenously.,2.  Demerol intravenously.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and sedated with the above medications.  The Olympus video colonoscope was inserted through the anus and was advanced in retrograde fashion through the sigmoid colon, descending colon, around the splenic flexure, into the transverse colon, around the hepatic flexure, down the ascending colon, into the cecum.  The cecum was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve.  The colonoscope was then advanced through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum, which was normal on examination.  The scope was then pulled back into the cecum and then slowly withdrawn.  The mucosa was examined in detail.  The mucosa was entirely normal.  Upon reaching the rectum, retroflex examination of the rectum was normal.  The scope was then straightened out, the air removed and the scope withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no apparent complications.,
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Left breast cancer.,HISTORY:,  The patient is a 57-year-old female, who I initially saw in the office on 12/27/07, as a referral from the Tomball Breast Center.  On 12/21/07, the patient underwent image-guided needle core biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion at the 7 o'clock position of the left breast (inferomedial).  The biopsy returned showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma high histologic grade.  The patient stated that she had recently felt and her physician had felt a palpable mass in that area prior to her breast imaging.  She prior to that area, denied any complaints.  She had no nipple discharge.  No trauma history.  She has had been on no estrogen supplementation.  She has had no other personal history of breast cancer.  Her family history is positive for her mother having breast cancer at age 48.  The patient has had no children and no pregnancies.  She denies any change in the right breast.  Subsequent to the office visit and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer, she has had medical oncology consultation with Dr. X and radiation oncology consultation with Dr. Y.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and Dr. Y, who are both in agreement with proceeding with surgery prior to adjuvant therapy.  The patient's metastatic workup has otherwise been negative with MRI scan and CT scanning.  The MRI scan showed some close involvement possibly involving the left pectoralis muscle, although thought to also possibly represent biopsy artifact.  CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen is negative for metastatic disease.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Previous surgery is history of benign breast biopsy in 1972, laparotomy in 1981, 1982, and 1984, right oophorectomy in 1984, and ganglion cyst removal of the hand in 1987.,MEDICATIONS:,  She is currently on omeprazole for reflux and indigestion.,ALLERGIES:,  SHE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.  Positive for restless leg syndrome.  Negative for any unexplained weight loss and no change in bowel or bladder habits.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Positive for breast cancer in her mother and also mesothelioma from possible asbestosis or asbestos exposure.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient works as a school teacher and teaching high school.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  The patient is a white female, alert and oriented x 3, appears her stated age of 57.,HEENT:  Head is atraumatic and normocephalic.  Sclerae are anicteric.,NECK:  Supple.,CHEST:  Clear.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,BREASTS:  Exam reveals an approximately 1.5 cm relatively mobile focal palpable mass in the inferomedial left breast at the 7 o'clock position, which clinically is not fixed to the underlying pectoralis muscle.  There are no nipple retractions.  No skin dimpling.  There is some, at the time of the office visit, ecchymosis from recent biopsy.  There is no axillary adenopathy.  The remainder of the left breast is without abnormality.  The right breast is without abnormality.  The axillary areas are negative for adenopathy bilaterally.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without masses.  No gross organomegaly.  No CVA or flank tenderness.,EXTREMITIES:  Grossly neurovascularly intact.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I have discussed with the patient in detail about the diagnosis of breast cancer and the surgical options, and medical oncologist has discussed with her issues about adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection.  The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient.  The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained.  Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained.  The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers.  She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding.  I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Prostate cancer.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Prostate cancer.,OPERATION: , Cystoscopy and removal of foreign objects from the urethra.,BRACHYTHERAPY:,  Iodine 125.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg IV preoperatively.,Total seeds were 59.  Activity of 0.439, 30 seeds in the periphery with 10 needles and total of 8 seeds at the anterior of the fold, 4 needles.  Please note that the total needles placed on the top were actually 38 seeds and 22 seeds were returned back.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 72-year-old male who presented to us with elevated PSA and prostate biopsy with Gleason 6 cancer on the right apex.  Options such as watchful waiting, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, and external beam radiation were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, dysuria, burning pain, hematuria, future procedures, and failure of the procedure were all discussed.  The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient wanted to wait until he came back from his summer vacations, so a one dose of Zoladex was given.  Prostate size measured about 15 g in the OR and about 22 g about two months ago.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed sterilely.  The scrotum was taped up using Ioban.  Transrectal ultrasound was done.  The prostate was measured 15 g.  Multiple images were taken.  A volume study was done.  This was given to the physicist, Dr. X was present who is radiation oncologist who helped with implanting of the seeds.  Total of 38 seeds were placed in the patient with 10 peripheral needles and then 4 internal needles.  Total of 30 seeds were placed in the periphery and total of 8 seeds were placed in the inside.  They were done directly under transrectal ultrasound vision.  The seeds were placed directly under ultrasound guidance.  There was a nice distribution of the seeds.  A couple of more seeds were placed on the right side due to the location of the prostate cancer.  Subsequently at the end of the procedure, fluoroscopy was done.  Couple of images were obtained.  Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure where a seed was visualized right in the urethra, which was grasped and pulled out using grasper, which was difficult to get the seed off of the spacers, which was actually pulled out.  There were no further seeds visualized in the bladder.  The bladder appeared normal.  At the end of the procedure, a Foley catheter was kept in place of 18 French and the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, and progressive quadriparesis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, progressive quadriparesis, and very poor bone quality as well as difficulty with hemostasis with the patient having been on aspirin.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE,1.  Anterior cervical discectomy, osteophytectomy, foraminotomies, spinal cord decompression at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.,2.  Microscope.,3.  Fusion with machined allografts at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.,4.  Eagle titanium plate from C3 to C6.,5.  Jackson-Pratt drain placement.,6.  Intraoperative monitoring with EMGs and SSEPs.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 350 cc.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,COUNTS: , Correct.,SPECIMENS SENT:  ,None.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted through the emergency room for progressive weakness and falling.  He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management was not an option.  The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such.  He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation was done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant.  This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment was achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar.  Decision was made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied.  The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss was 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimens were sent.,The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.
REASON FOR VISIT:,  Six-month follow-up visit for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).,She reports that she is getting occasional chest pains with activity.  Sometimes she feels that at night when she is lying in bed and it concerns her.,She is frustrated by her inability to lose weight even though she is hyperthyroid.,MEDICATIONS: , Tapazole 10 mg b.i.d., atenolol/chlorthalidone 50/25 mg b.i.d., Micro-K 10 mEq q.d., Lanoxin 0.125 mg q.d., spironolactone 25 mg q.d., Crestor 10 mg q.h.s., famotidine 20 mg, Bayer Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Vicodin p.r.n., and Nexium 40 mg-given samples of this today.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  No palpitations.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the "early stages of a likely dementia" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began "as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was "too derogatory."  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated "diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined."  It concluded that "results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot "like dragging."  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Residual stone, status post right percutaneous nephrolithotomy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Residual stone status post right percutaneous nephrolithotomy, attempted second-look nephrolithotomy, cysto with insertion of 6-French variable length double-J stent.,ANESTHESIA:,  General via endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,DRAINS: , 16-French Foley, 6-French variable length double-J stent.,INTRAOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS: , Unable to re-access the collecting system.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and laid supine.  General anesthesia was accomplished.  A 16-French Foley was placed using aseptic technique.  The patient was then placed on the operating table prone.  His right flank was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  At this point, contrast was injected through his existing nephrostomy tube and there was no continuity with the collecting system and it was removed.  The 5-French Pollack catheter was used to pass a 0.38 super-stiff Amplatz wire.  The wire would not go down the ureter.  Multiple attempts were made using Pollack catheters and Cobra catheters and attempts were made to dilate the track, both with rigid dilator and the balloon dilator and access could not be obtained.  After multiple attempts, access was lost.  At this point, the tubes were left out of the kidney and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then placed on another operating table supine.  His genitalia were prepped and draped after removing his Foley catheter.  Flexible cystoscopy was performed and the right orifice identified, which was edematous and erythematous.  The wire was passed up to kidney and a 5-French Pollack catheter was then passed over to after the removing the scope.  The wire was removed.  Contrast injection with good placement in the collecting system.  The wire was replaced.  The Pollack catheter removed and 6-French variable length double-J stent was inserted using fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire was removed leaving the double-J stent in good position.  _______ 16-French Foley was reinserted and connected to close drains.,Procedure was terminated at this point and had been well tolerated.  The patient was awakened and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient returns for followup evaluation 21 months after undergoing prostate fossa irradiation for recurrent Gleason 8 adenocarcinoma.  His urinary function had been stable until 2 days ago.  Over the past couple of days he has been waking every 1 to 1-1/2 hours and has had associated abdominal cramping, as well as a bit of sore throat (his wife has had a cold for about 2 weeks).  His libido remains intact (but he has not been sexually functional), but his erections have been dysfunctional.  The bowel function is stable with occasional irritative hemorrhoidal symptoms.  He has had no hematochezia.  The PSA has been slowly rising in recent months.  This month it reached 1.2.,PAIN ASSESSMENT: , Abdominal cramping in the past 2 days.  No more than 1 to 2 of 10 in intensity.,PERFORMANCE STATUS: , Karnofsky score 100.  He continues to work full-time.,NUTRITIONAL STATUS: , Appetite has been depressed over the past couple of days, and he has lost about 5 pounds.  (Per him, mostly this week.),PSYCHIATRIC: , Some stress regarding upcoming IRS audits of clients.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Otherwise noncontributory.,MEDICATIONS,1.  NyQuil.,2.  Timolol eye drops.,3.  Aspirin.,4.  Advil.,5.  Zinc.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  Pleasant, well-developed, gentleman in no acute distress.  Weight is 197 pounds.,HEENT:  Sclerae and conjunctivae are clear.  Extraocular movement are intact.  Hearing is grossly intact.  The oral cavity is without thrush.  There is minor pharyngitis.,LYMPH NODES:  No palpable lymphadenopathy.,SKELETAL:  No focal skeletal tenderness.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without palpable mass or organomegaly.,DIGITAL RECTAL EXAMINATION:  There are external hemorrhoids.  The prostate fossa is flat without suspicious nodularity.  There is no blood on the examining glove.,EXTREMITIES:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Without focal deficit.,IMPRESSION:,  Concerning slow ongoing rise in PSA.,PLAN: , Discussed significance of this in detail with the patient.  He understands the probability that there may be residual cancer although the location is unknown.  For now there is no good evidence that early management affects the ultimate prognosis.  Accordingly, he is comfortable with careful monitoring, and I have asked him to return here in 3 months with an updated PSA.  I also suggested that he reestablish contact with Dr. X at his convenience.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Rule out temporal arteritis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Rule out temporal arteritis.,PROCEDURE:,  Bilateral temporal artery biopsy.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.,INDICATIONS:,  I was consulted by Dr. X for this patient with bilateral temporal headaches to rule out temporal arteritis.  I explained fully the procedure to the patient.,PROCEDURE: , Both sides were done exactly the same way.  After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery.  The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides.  Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult.  The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm.  They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled.  The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond.  She tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Facial and neck skin ptosis.  Cheek, neck, and jowl lipotosis. Facial rhytides.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,PROCEDURE: , Temporal cheek-neck facelift (CPT 15825).  Submental suction assisted lipectomy (CPT 15876).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is a 65-year-old female who has progressive aging changes of the face and neck.  The patient demonstrates the deformities described above and has requested surgical correction.  The procedure, risks, limitations, and alternatives in this individual case have been very carefully discussed with the patient.  The patient has consented to surgery.,The patient was brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  An intravenous line was started and anesthesia was maintained throughout the case.  The patient was monitored for cardiac, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation continuously.,The hair was prepared and secured with rubber bands and micropore tape along the incision line.  A marking pen had been used to outline the area of the incisions, which included the preauricular area to the level of the tragus, the post-tragal region, the post auricular region and into the hairline.  In addition, the incision was marked in the temporal area in the event of a temporal lift, then across the coronal scalp for the forehead lift.  The incision was marked in the submental crease for the submental lipectomy and liposuction.  The incision in the post auricular area extended up on the posterior aspect of the ear and ended near the occipital hairline.,The areas to be operated on were injected with 1% Lidocaine containing 1:100,000 Epinephrine.  This provided local anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The total of Lidocaine used throughout the procedure was maintained at no more than 500mg.,SUBMENTAL SUCTION ASSISTED LIPECTOMY: , The incision was made, as previously outlined, in the submental crease in a transverse direction, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A Metzenbaum scissors was used to elevate the area in the submental region for about 2 or 3cm and making radial tunnels from the angle of the mandible all the way to the next angle of the mandible.  4mm liopsuction cannula was then introduced along these previously outlined tunnels into the jowl on both sides and down top the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid laterally and just past the thyroid notch interiorly.  The tunnels were enlarged with a 6mm flat liposuction cannula.,Then with the Wells-Johnson liposuction machine 27-29 inches of underwater mercury suction was accomplished in all tunnels.  Care was taken not to turn the opening of the suction cannula up to the dermis, but it was rotated in and out taking a symmetrical amount of fat from each area.  A similar procedure was performed with the 4 mm cannula cleaning the area.  Bilateral areas were palpated for symmetry, and any remaining fat was then suctioned directly.,A triangular wedge of anterior platysma border was cauterized and excised at the cervical mental angle.  A plication stitch of 3-0 Vicryl was placed.,When a satisfactory visible result had been accomplished from the liposuction, the inferior flap was then advanced over anteriorly and the overlying skin excised in an incremental fashion.  5-0 plain catgut was used for closure in a running interlocking fashion.  The wound was cleaned at the end, dried, and Mastisol applied.  Then tan micropore tape was placed for support to the entire area.,FACE LIFT: , After waiting approximately 10-15 minutes for adequate vasoconstriction the post auricular incision was started at the earlobe and continued up on the posterior aspect of the ear for approximately 2cm just superior to the external auditory canal.  A gentle curve was then made, and again the incision was carried down to and into the posterior hairline paralleling the hair follicles and directed posteriorly towards the occipital region.  A preauricular incision was carried into the natural crease superior to the tragus, curved posterior to the tragus bilaterally then brought out inferiorly in the natural crease between the lobule and preauricular skin.  The incision was made in the temporal area beveling parallel with the hair follicles.  (The incision had been designed with curve underneath the sideburn in order to maintain the sideburn hair locations and then curved posteriorly.),The plane of dissection in the hairbearing area was kept deep to the roots of the hair follicles and superficial to the fascia of the temporalis muscle and sternocleidomastoid.  The dissection over the temporalis muscle was continued anteriorly towards the anterior hairline and underneath the frontalis to the supraorbital rim.  At the superior level of the zygoma and at the level of the sideburn, dissection was brought more superficially in order to avoid the nerves and vessels in the areas, specifically the frontalis branch of the facial nerve.,The facial flaps were then elevated with both blunt and sharp dissection with the Kahn facelift dissecting scissors in the post auricular region to pass the angle of the mandible.  This area of undermining was connected with an area of undermining starting with the temporal region extending in the preauricular area of the cheek out to the jowl.  Great care was taken to direct the plane of dissecting superficial to the parotid fascia or SMAS.  The entire dissection was carried in a radial fashion from the ear for approximately 4cm at the lateral canthal area to 8-10cm in the neck region.  When the areas of dissection had been connected carefully, hemostasis was obtained and all areas inspected.  At no point were muscle fibers or major vessels or nerves encountered in the dissection.,The SMAS was sharply incised in a semilunar fashion in front of the ear and in front of the anterior border of the SCM.  The SMAS flap was then advanced posteriorly and superiorly.  The SMAS was split at the level of the earlobe, and the inferior portion was sutured to the mastoid periosteum.  The excess SMAS was trimmed and excised from the portion anterior to the auricle.  The SMAS was then imbricated with 2-0 Surgidak interrupted sutures.,The area was then inspected for any bleeding points and careful hemostasis obtained.  The flaps were then rotated and advanced posteriorly and then superiorly, and incremental cuts were made and the suspension points in the pre and post auricular area were done with 2-0 Tycron suture.  The excess and redundant amount of skin were then excised and trimmed cautiously so as not to cause any downward pull on the ear lobule or any stretching of the scars in the healing period.  Skin closure was accomplished in the hairbearing areas with 5-0 Nylon in the preauricular tuft and 4-0 Nylon interrupted in the post auricular area.  The pre auricular area was closed first with 5-0 Dexon at the ear lobules, and 6-0 Nylon at the lobules, and 5-0 plain catgut in a running interlocking fashion.  5-0 Plain catgut was used in the post auricular area as well, leaving ample room for serosanguinous drainage into the dressing.  The post tragal incisin was closed with interrupted and running interlocking 5-0 plain catgut.  The exact similar procedure was repeated on the left side.,At the end of this procedure, all flaps were inspected for adequate capillary filling or any evidence of hematoma formation.  Any small amount of fluid was expressed post-auricularly.  A fully perforated bulb suction drain was placed under the flap and exited posterior to the hairline on each side prior to the suture closure.  A Bacitracin impregnated nonstick dressing was cut to conform to the pre and post auricular area and placed over the incision lines.,ABD padding over 4X4 gauze was used to cover the pre and post auricular areas.  This was wrapped around the head in a vertical circumferential fashion and anchored with white micropore tape in a non-constricting but secured fashion.  The entire dressing complex was secured with a pre-formed elastic stretch wrap device.  All branches of the facial nerve were checked and appeared to be functioning normally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to home in satisfactory condition.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Questionable need for antibiotic therapy for possible lower extremity cellulitis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 51-year-old Caucasian female with past medical history of morbid obesity and chronic lower extremity lymphedema.  She follows up at the wound care center at Hospital.  Her lower extremity edema is being managed there.  She has had multiple episodes of cellulitis of the lower extremities for which she has received treatment with oral Bactrim and ciprofloxacin in the past according to her.  As her lymphedema was not improving on therapy at that facility, she was referred for admission to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for lymphedema management.  She at present has a stage II ulcer on the lower part of the medial aspect of left leg without any drainage and has slight erythema of bilateral lower calf and shin areas.  Her measurements for lymphedema wraps have been taken and in my opinion, it is going to be started in a day or two.,I have been consulted to rule out the possibility of lower extremity cellulitis that may require antibiotic therapy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Positive for morbid obesity, chronic lymphedema of the lower extremities, at least for the last three years, spastic colon, knee arthritis, recurrent cellulitis of the lower extremities.  She has had a hysterectomy and a cholecystectomy in the remote past.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives by herself and has three pet cats.  She is an ex-smoker, quit smoking about five years ago.  She occasionally drinks a glass of wine.  She denies any other recreational drugs use.  She recently retired from State of Pennsylvania as a psychiatric aide after 32 years of service.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Positive for mother passing away at the age of 38 from heart problems and alcoholism, dad passed away at the age of 75 from leukemia.  One of her uncles was diagnosed with leukemia.,ALLERGIES: , ADHESIVE TAPE ALLERGIES.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  At present, the patient is admitted with a nonresolving bilateral lower extremity lymphedema, which is a little bit more marked on the right lower extremity compared to the left.  She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She denies any pain, tenderness, increased warmth or drainage from the lower extremities.  Denies chest pain, cough or phlegm production.  All other systems reviewed were negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  A 51-year-old morbidly obese Caucasian female who is not in any acute hemodynamic distress at present.,Vital signs:  Her maximum recorded temperature since admission today is 96.8, pulse is 65 per minute, respiratory rate is 18 to 20 per minute, blood pressure is 150/54, I do not see a recorded weight at present.,HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Head is normocephalic and external ear exam is normal.,Neck:  Supple.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy.,Cardiovascular system:  Regular rate and rhythm of the heart without any appreciable murmur, rub or gallop.  Heart sounds are little distant secondary to thick chest wall.,Lungs:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.,Abdomen:  Morbidly obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, there is no percussible organomegaly, there is no evidence of lymphedema on the abdominal pannus.  There is no evidence of cutaneous candidiasis in the inguinal folds.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the inguinal and femoral areas.,Extremities:  Bilateral lower extremities with evidence of extensive lymphedema, there is slight pinkish discoloration of the lower part of calf and shin areas, most likely secondary to stasis dermatosis.  There is no increased warmth or tenderness, there is no skin breakdown except a stage II chronic ulcer on the lower medial aspect of the right calf area.  It has minimal serosanguineous drainage and there is no surrounding erythema.  Therefore, in my opinion, there is no current evidence of cellulitis or wound infection.  There is no cyanosis or clubbing.  There is no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.,Central nervous system:  The patient is alert and oriented x3, cranial nerves II through XII are intact, and there is no focal deficit appreciated.,LABORATORY DATA: , White cell count is 7.4, hemoglobin 12.9, hematocrit 39, platelet count of 313,000, differential is normal with 51% neutrophils, 37% lymphocytes, 9% monocytes and 3% eosinophils.  The basic electrolyte panel is within normal limits and the renal function is normal with BUN of 17 and creatinine of 0.5.  Liver function tests are also within normal limits.,The nasal screen for MRSA is negative.  Urine culture is negative so far from admission.  Urinalysis was negative for pyuria, leucocyte esterase, and nitrites.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  A 51-year-old Caucasian female with multiple medical problems mentioned above including history of morbid obesity and chronic lower extremity lymphedema.  Admitted for inpatient management of bilateral lower extremity lymphedema.  I have been consulted to rule out possibility of active cellulitis and wound infection.,At present, I do not find evidence of active cellulitis that needs antibiotic therapy.  In my opinion, lymphedema wraps could be initiated.  We will continue to monitor her legs with lymphedema wraps changes 2 to 3 times a week.  If she develops any cellulitis, then appropriate antibiotic therapy will be initiated. ,Her stage II ulcer on the right leg does not look infected.  I would recommend continuation of wound care along with lymphedema wraps.,Other medical problems will continue to be followed and treated by Dr. X's group during this hospitalization.  Dr. Y from Plastic Surgery and Lymphedema Management Clinic is following.,I appreciate the opportunity of participating in this patient's care.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at any time.  I will continue to follow the patient along with you 2-3 times per week during this hospitalization at the Long-Term Acute Care Facility.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hydrocele.,OPERATION: , Left hydrocelectomy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hydrocele.,ANESTHESIA: , General,INDICATIONS AND STUDIES: , This is a 67-year-old male with pain, left scrotum.  He has had an elevated PSA and also has erectile dysfunction.  He comes in now for a left hydrocelectomy.  Physical exam confirmed obvious hydrocele, left scrotum, approximately 8 cm.  Laboratory data included a hematocrit of 43.5, hemoglobin of 15.0, and white count 4700.  Creatinine 1.3, sodium 141, and potassium 4.0.  Calcium 8.6.  Chest x-ray was unremarkable.  EKG was normal.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia, prepped and draped in supine position, and left scrotal incision was made, carried down to the tunica vaginalis forming the hydrocele.  This was dissected free from the scrotal wall back to the base of the testicle and then excised back to the spermatic cord.  In the fashion, the hydrocele was excised and fluid drained.,Cord was infiltrated with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  The edges of the tunica vaginalis adjacent to the spermatic cord were oversewn with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures for hemostasis.  The left testicle was replaced into the left scrotal compartment and affixed to the overlying Dartos fascia with a 3-0 Vicryl suture through the edge of the tunica vaginalis and the overlying Dartos fascia.,The left scrotal incision was closed, first closing the Dartos fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin was closed with an interrupted running 4-0 chromic suture.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, upon awakening from general anesthesia.  Plan is to discharge the patient and see him back in the office in a week or 2 in followup.  Further plans will depend upon how he does.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Burn, right arm.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a Workers' Compensation injury.  This patient, a 41 year-old male, was at a coffee shop, where he works as a cook, and hot oil splashed onto his arm, burning from the elbow to the wrist on the medial aspect.  He has had it cooled, and presents with his friend to the Emergency Department for care.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Noncontributory.,MEDICATIONS:  ,None.,ALLERGIES:  ,None.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished 21-year-old male adult who is appropriate and cooperative.  His only injury is to the right upper extremity.  There are first and second degree burns on the right forearm, ranging from the elbow to the wrist.  Second degree areas with blistering are scattered through the medial aspect of the forearm.  There is no circumferential burn, and I see no areas of deeper burn.  The patient moves his hands well.  Pulses are good.  Circulation to the hand is fine.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,1.  First-degree and second-degree burns, right arm secondary to hot oil spill.,2.  Workers' Compensation industrial injury.,TREATMENT: , The wound is cooled and cleansed with soaking in antiseptic solution.  The patient was ordered Demerol 50 mg IM for pain, but he refused and did not want pain medication.  A burn dressing is applied with Neosporin ointment.  The patient is given Tylenol No. 3, tabs #4, to take home with him and take one or two every four hours p.r.n. for pain.  He is to return tomorrow for a dressing change.  Tetanus immunization is up to date.  Preprinted instructions are given.  Workers' Compensation first report and work status report are completed.,DISPOSITION: , Home.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Respiratory failure improved.,2.  Hypotension resolved.,3.  Anemia of chronic disease stable.,4.  Anasarca improving.,5.  Protein malnourishment improving.,6.  End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.,LABORATORY DATA: , Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  Electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 26, glucose 79, BUN 56, and creatinine 1.4.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9.,PLAN:  ,Discharge this gentleman from Hospital and admit him to Garden Court SNF where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  Hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  He has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  The family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time.
CC:, Memory difficulty.,HX: ,This 64 y/o RHM had had difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for 12 months prior to presentation, on 2/28/95. This had been called to his attention by the clerical staff at his parish--he was a Catholic priest. He had had no professional or social faux pas or mishaps due to his memory. He could not tell whether his problem was becoming worse, so he brought himself to the Neurology clinic on his own referral.,MEDS:, None.,PMH: ,1)appendectomy, 2)tonsillectomy, 3)childhood pneumonia, 4)allergy to sulfa drugs.,FHX:, Both parents experienced memory problems in their ninth decades, but not earlier. 5 siblings have had no memory trouble. There are no neurological illnesses in his family.,SHX:, Catholic priest. Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.,EXAM:,  BP131/74, HR78, RR12, 36.9C, Wt. 77kg, Ht. 178cm.,MS: A&O to person, place and time. 29/30 on MMSE; 2/3 recall at 5 minutes. 2/10 word recall at 10 minutes. Unable to remember the name of the President (Clinton). 23words/60 sec on Category fluency testing (normal). Mild visual constructive deficit.,The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable and there were no extrapyramidal signs or primitive reflexes noted.,COURSE:, TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, RPR non-reactive. Neuropsychological evaluation, 3/6/95, revealed: 1)well preserved intellectual functioning and orientation, 2) significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency and working memory, 3)performances which were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction and clock drawing, 4)limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction. The findings indicated multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction. With the exception of the patient's report of minimal occupational dysfunction ( which may reflect poor insight), the clinical picture is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer's disease. MRI brain, 3/6/95, showed mild generalized atrophy, more severe in the occipital-parietal regions.,In 4/96, his performance on repeat neuropsychological evaluation was relatively stable. His verbal learning and delayed recognition were within normal limits, whereas delayed recall was "moderately severely" impaired. Immediate and delayed visual memory were slightly below expectations. Temporal orientation and expressive language skills were below expectation, especially in word retrieval. These findings were suggestive of particular, but not exclusive, involvement of the temporal lobes.,On 9/30/96, he was evaluated for a 5 minute spell of visual loss, OU. The episode occurred on Friday, 9/27/96, in the morning while sitting at his desk doing paperwork. He suddenly felt that his gaze was pulled toward a pile of letters; then a "curtain" came down over both visual fields, like "everything was in the shade." During the episode he felt fully alert and aware of his surroundings. He concurrently heard a "grating sound" in his head. After the episode, he made several phone calls, during which he reportedly sounded confused, and perseverated about opening a bank account. He then drove to visit his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, without accident. He was reportedly "normal" when he reached her house. He was able to perform Mass over the weekend without any difficulty. Neurologic examination, 9/30/96, was notable for: 1)category fluency score of 18items/60 sec. 2)VFFTC and EOM were intact. There was no RAPD, INO, loss of visual acuity. Glucose 178 (elevated), ESR ,Lipid profile, GS, CBC with differential, Carotid duplex scan, EKG, and EEG were all normal. MRI brain, 9/30/96, was unchanged from previous, 3/6/95.,On 1/3/97, he had a 30 second spell of lightheadedness without vertigo, but with balance difficulty, after picking up a box of books. The episode was felt due to orthostatic changes.,1/8/97 neuropsychological evaluation was stable and his MMSE score was 25/30 (with deficits in visual construction, orientation, and 2/3 recall at 1 minute). Category fluency score 23 items/60 sec. Neurologic exam was notable for graphesthesia in the left hand.,In 2/97, he had episodes of anxiety, marked fluctuations in job performance and resigned his pastoral position. His neurologic exam was unchanged. An FDG-PET scan on 2/14/97 revealed decreased uptake in the right posterior temporal-parietal and lateral occipital regions.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Enlarged fibroid uterus.,2.  Hypermenorrhea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Enlarged fibroid uterus.,2.  Hypermenorrhea.,3.  Secondary anemia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Dilatation and curettage.,2.  Hysteroscopy.,GROSS FINDINGS: , Uterus was anteverted, greatly enlarged, irregular and firm.  The cervix is patulous and nulliparous without lesions.  Adnexal examination was negative for masses.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where she was properly prepped and draped in sterile manner under general anesthesia.  After bimanual examination, the cervix was exposed with a weighted vaginal speculum and the anterior lip of the cervix grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded to a depth of 11 cm.  The endocervical canal was then progressively dilated with Hanks and Hegar dilators to a #10 Hegar.  The ACMI hysteroscope was then introduced into the uterine cavity using sterile saline solution as a distending media and with attached video camera.  The endometrial cavity was distended with fluids and the cavity visualized.  Multiple irregular areas of fibroid degeneration were noted throughout the cavity.  The coronal areas were visualized bilaterally with corresponding tubal ostia.  A moderate amount of proliferative appearing endometrium was noted.  There were no direct intraluminal lesions seen.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Several pictures were taken of the endometrial cavity and the hysteroscope removed from the cavity.,A large sharp curet was then used to obtain a moderate amount of tissue, which was the sent to pathologist for analysis.  The instrument was removed from the vaginal vault.  The patient was sent to recovery area in satisfactory postoperative condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux with right reflux nephropathy after Deflux injection.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux with right reflux nephropathy after Deflux injection.,PROCEDURE:,  Cystoscopy under anesthesia, bilateral HIT/STING with Deflux under general anesthetic.,ANESTHESIA: , General inhalational anesthetic.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: , 250 mL crystalloids.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,SPECIMENS:,  Urine sent for culture.,ABNORMAL FINDINGS:  ,Gaping ureteral orifices, right greater than left, with Deflux not in or near the ureteral orifices.  Right ureteral orifice was HIT with 1.5 mL of Deflux and left with 1.2 mL of Deflux.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 4-1/2-year-old boy with history of reflux nephropathy and voiding and bowel dysfunction.  He has had a STING procedure performed but continues to have reflux bilaterally.  Plan is for another injection.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given.  He was then placed in a lithotomy position with adequate padding of his arms and legs.  His urethra was calibrated to 12-French with a bougie a boule.  A 9.5-French cystoscope was used and the offset system was then used.  His urethra was normal without valves or strictures.  His bladder was fairly normal with minimal trabeculations but no cystitis noted.  Upon evaluation, the patient's right ureteral orifice was found to be remarkably gaping and the Deflux that was present was not in or near ureteral orifice but it was inferior to it below the trigone.  This was similarly found on the left side where the Deflux was not close to the orifice as well.  It was slightly more difficult because of the amount impacted upon our angle for injection.  We were able to ultimately get the Deflux to go ahead with HIT technique on the right into the ureter itself to inject a total of 1.5 mL to include the HIT technique as well as the ureteral orifice itself on the right and left sides and some on the uppermost aspect.  Once we injected this, we ran the irrigant over the orifice and it no longer fluttered and there was no bleeding.  Similar procedure was done on the left.  This was actually more difficult as the Deflux injection from before displaced the ureter slightly more laterally but again HIT technique was performed.  There was some mild bleeding and Deflux was used to stop this as well and again no evidence of fluttering of the ureteral orifice after injection.  At the end of the procedure, the irrigant was drained and 2% lidocaine jelly was instilled in the urethra.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to Recovery.  A low-dose of IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure as well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Dental caries.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Dental caries.,PROCEDURE: , Dental restorations and extractions.,CLINICAL HISTORY: , This 23-year-old male is a client of the ABC Center because of his disability, the nature of which is unclear to me at this time; however, he reportedly has several issues that qualify him as disabled.  He has had multiple severe carious lesions that warrant multiple extractions at this time.  It is also unclear to me as to how his prior or existing restorations were accomplished.  In any case, he has been cleared for the procedure today.  He has his history and physical in the chart.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room at 11 o'clock and placed in the supine position.  Dr. X administered the general anesthetic, after which a throat pack was placed.  Available full mouth x-rays were reviewed.  These x-rays were taken at another location.  Teeth 2, 4, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, 27, and 31 were all in varying degrees of severe decay from complete destruction of the crowns to pulp exposures with periapical radiolucencies.  All of these aforementioned teeth were extracted using combinations of forceps and elevators.  Hemostasis in all of these sites was accomplished with direct pressure using gauze packs.  ,Tooth 5 had caries in the distal surface extending to the occlusal as well as another carious lesion in the buccal.  These carious lesions and his tooth were excavated, and the tooth was restored with amalgam involving these surfaces.  ,Tooth 6 had caries on the facial surface, which was excavated, and the tooth was restored with composite.  ,Tooth 7 had caries involving the distal surface.  ,Tooth 8 likewise had caries involving the distal surface, and both of these distal lesions extended into incisal area.  These carious lesions were excavated, and both of these teeth were restored with composite.  ,Tooth 9 had caries in a mesial surface and a buccal surface, which was excavated, and this tooth was restored with composite.  ,Tooth 28 caries in the mesial surface extending to the occlusal, which was excavated, and the tooth was restored with amalgam, and tooth 30 had carries in the buccal surface, which was excavated, and the tooth was restored with amalgam.  ,A prophylaxis was done, primarily using a rotating rubber cup and some minor scaling, and the mouth was irrigated and suctioned thoroughly.  The throat pack was removed, and the patient was awakened and brought to the recovery room in good condition at 1330 hours.  There was negligible blood loss.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Soft tissue mass, right knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Soft tissue mass, right knee.,2.  Osteophyte lateral femoral condyle, right knee.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:, Excision of capsular mass and arthrotomy with ostectomy of lateral femoral condyle, right knee.,SPECIFICATION: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a local and IV sedation via the Anesthesia Department.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:,  This is a 37-year-old African-American male with a mass present at the posterolateral aspect of his right knee.  On aspiration, it was originally attempted to no avail.  There was a long-standing history of this including two different MRIs, one about a year ago and one very recently both of which did not delineate the mass present.  During aspiration previously, the patient had experienced neuritic type symptoms down his calf, which have mostly resolved by the time that this had occurred.  The patient continued to complain of pain and dysfunction to his calf.  This was discussed with him at length.  He wished this to be explored and the mass excised even though knowing the possibility that they would not change his pain pattern with the potential of reoccurrence as well as the potential of scar stiffness, swelling, and peroneal nerve palsy.  With this, he decided to proceed.,Upon observation preoperatively, the patient was noted to have a hard mass present to the posterolateral aspect of the right knee.  It was noted to be tender.  It was marked preoperatively prior to an anesthetic.  Upon dissection, the patient was noted to have significant thickening of the posterior capsule.  The posterolateral aspect of the knee above the posterolateral complex at the gastroc attachment to the lateral femoral condyle.  There was also noted to be prominence of the lateral femoral condyle ridge.  The bifurcation at the tibial and peroneal nerves were identified and no neuroma was present.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table.  After receiving IV sedation, he was placed prone.  Thigh tourniquet was placed.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A transverse incision was carried down across the crease with a mass had been palpated through skin and subcutaneous tissue after exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet utilized.  The nerve was identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  Both nerves were identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  There was noted to be no neuroma present.  This was taken down until the gastroc was split.  There was gross thickening of the joint capsule and after arthrotomy, a section of the capsule was excised.  The lateral femoral condyle was then osteophied.  We then smoothed off with a rongeur.  After this, we could not palpate any mass whatsoever placing pressure upon the area of the nerve.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was checked again.  There was no excessive swelling.  Swanson drain was placed to the depth of the wound and interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and #4-0 nylon was utilized for skin closure.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were warm _______ pulses distally at the end of the case.  The tourniquet as stated has been deflated prior to closure and hemostasis was controlled.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded.
PROCEDURE: , Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 2-year, 2-month-old little girl who presented to the hospital with severe anemia, hemoglobin 5.8, elevated total bilirubin consistent with hemolysis and weak positive direct Coombs test.  She was transfused with packed red blood cells.  Her hemolysis seemed to slow down.  She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen.  Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital.  She had a blood culture, which was also negative.  She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously.  Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics.  After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present.  She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI.,I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures.  The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression.  Questions were answered to their satisfaction.  They would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After "time out" procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained.  She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself.  She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied.  She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision.  Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact.  The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained.  The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied.  Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back.,During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable.  Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back.,Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose.,DISPOSITION: , The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right hydronephrosis.,2.  Right flank pain.,3.  Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right hydronephrosis.,2.  Right flank pain.,3.  Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology.,4.  Extrarenal pelvis on the right.,5.  No evidence of obstruction or ureteral/bladder lesions.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Cystoscopy.,2.  Bilateral retrograde ureteropyelograms.,3.  Right ureteral barbotage for urine cytology.,4.  Right ureterorenoscopy, diagnostic.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: , Urine and saline wash barbotage from right ureter through the ureteral catheter.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Minimal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This is a 70-year-old female who reports progressive intermittent right flank pain associated with significant discomfort and disability.  She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone.  She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter.  She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile.  She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia.  She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities.  The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter.  This was gently advanced to the mid ureter.  Urine was collected for cytology.  Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen.  This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter.  An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter.  The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis.  Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected.  The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level.  There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones.  The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate.  The ureteroscope was then removed.  The cystoscope was reinserted.  Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system.  No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized.  The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system.  The cystoscope was removed.  Foley catheter was inserted.  The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.
SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient comes back to see me today.  She is a pleasant 77-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with right leg pain.  She has a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis.  She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines.,The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.  She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily.  She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms.  She is using a cane to help her ambulate.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unchanged from her visit of 04/15/2005.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female.,Vital Signs:  Height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Weight is 149 pounds.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Benign.,Neck:  Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's.,Musculoskeletal:  Examination shows some mild degenerative joint disease of both knees with grade weakness of her right hip flexors and half-grade weakness of her right hip adductors and right quadriceps, as compared to the left.  Straight leg raises are negative bilaterally.  Posterior tibials are palpable bilaterally.,Skin and Lymphatics:  Examination of the skin does not reveal any additional scars, rashes, cafe au lait spots or ulcers.  No significant lymphadenopathy noted.,Spine:  Examination shows lumbar scoliosis with surgical scar with no major tenderness.  Spinal movements are limited but functional.,Neurological:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  She has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical.  Sensations are intact to pinprick.,FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION:,  Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Degenerative disk disease of the right hip, symptomatic.,2.  Low back syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, clinically right L2 radiculopathy, stable.,3.  Low back pain with lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, stable.,4.  Facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right, stable.,5.  Post left hip arthroplasty.,6.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  The patient is symptomatic primarily on her right hip and is planning on seeing an orthopedic surgeon for possible right hip replacement.  In the interim, her Ultracet is not quite taking care of her pain.  I have asked her to discontinue it and we will start her on Tylenol #3, up to four times a day.  I have written a prescription for this for 120 tablets and two refills.  The patient will call for the refills when she needs them.  I will plan further follow up in six months, sooner if needed.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  Physical exam findings, history of present illness and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low back pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Low back pain.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Lumbar discogram L2-3.,2.  Lumbar discogram L3-4.,3.  Lumbar discogram L4-5.,4.  Lumbar discogram L5-S1.,ANESTHESIA:  ,IV sedation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Radiology Suite and placed prone onto a radiolucent table.  The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained.  We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.,A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.
REASON FOR CONSULT: , I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.  Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  Then, she began vomiting.  When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.,She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI.  I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG.  She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.,MEDICATIONS: , Medications as an outpatient:,1.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.,2.  Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.,ALLERGIES:  ,CODEINE.  NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative for cardiac disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes.  She uses alcohol.  No use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives with her daughter.  She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  O2 saturation 100%.  On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membrane.  She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  Neck veins are not distended.  No carotid bruits visible.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Extremities:  Without edema, on limited exam.  Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.,DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA: , EKGs as reviewed above.  Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds.  Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.,Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.,2.  Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.,3.  Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.,Other management as per the medical service.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Fractured and retained lumbar subarachnoid spinal catheter.,2.  Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension).,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  L1 laminotomy.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  Retrieval of foreign body (retained lumbar spinal catheter).,4.  Attempted insertion of new external lumbar drain.,5.  Fluoroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,The patient had a lumbar subarachnoid drain placed yesterday.  All went well with the surgery.  The catheter stopped draining and on pulling back the catheter, it fractured and CT scan showed that the remaining fragment is deep to the lamina.  The patient continues to have right eye blindness and headaches, presumably from the pseudotumor cerebri.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the operating room table resting on chest rolls.  Her face was resting in a pink foam headrest.  Extreme care was taken positioning her because she weighs 92 kg.  There was a lot of extra padding for her limbs and her limbs were positioned comfortably.  The arms were not hyperextended.  Great care was taken with positioning of the head and making sure there was no pressure on her eyes especially since she already has visual disturbance.  A Foley catheter was in place.  She received IV Cipro 400 mg because she is allergic to most antibiotics.,Fluoroscopy was used to locate the lower end of the fractured catheter and the skin was marked.  It was also marked where we would try to insert the new catheter at the L4 or L3 interspinous space.,The patient was then prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A 7-cm incision was made over the L1 lamina.  The incision was carried down through the fascia all the way down to the spinous processes.  A self-retaining McCullough retractor was placed.  The laminae were quite deep.  The microscope was brought in and using the Midas Rex drill with the AM-8 bit and removing some of the spinous process of L1-L2 with double-action rongeurs, the laminotomy was then done using the drill and great care was taken and using a 2-mm rongeur, the last layer of lamina was removed exposing the epidural fat and dura.  The opening in the bone was 1.5 x 1.5 cm.,Occasionally, bipolar cautery was used for bleeding of epidural veins, but this cautery was kept to a minimum.,Under high magnification, the dura was opened with an 11 blade and microscissors.  At first, there was a linear incision vertically to the left of midline, and I then needed to make a horizontal incision more towards the right.  The upper aspect of the cauda equina was visualized and perhaps the lower end of the conus.  Microdissection under high magnification did not expose the catheter.  The fluoroscope was brought in 2 more times including getting a lateral view and the fluoroscope appeared to show that the catheter should be in this location.,I persisted with intensive microdissection and finally we could see the catheter deep to the nerves and I was able to pull it out with the microforceps.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,At this point, I then attempted lumbar puncture by making a small incision with an 11 blade in the L4 interspinous space and then later in the L3 interspinous space and attempted to puncture the dural sac with the Tuohy needle.  Dr. Y also tried.  Despite using the fluoroscope and our best attempts, we were not able to convincingly puncture the lumbar subarachnoid space and so the attempted placement of the new lumbar catheter had to be abandoned.  It will be done at a later date.,I felt it was unsafe to place a new catheter at this existing laminotomy site because it was very high up near the conus.  The potential for complications involving her spinal cord was greater and we have already had a complication of the catheter now and I just did not think it was safe to put in this location.,Under high magnification, the dura was closed with #6-0 PDS interrupted sutures.,After the dura was closed, a piece of Gelfoam was placed over the dura.  The paraspinous muscles were closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  The subcutaneous fascia was also closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted suture.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and the skin with #4-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The 4-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures were also used at the lumbar puncture sites to close the skin.,The patient was then turned carefully on to her bed after sterile dressings were applied and then taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts correct.  Blood loss minimal, none replaced.  This procedure took 5 hours.  This case was also extremely difficult due to patient's size and the difficulty of locating the catheter deep to the cauda equina.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 61-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of feet and hand cramps.  He states that for the past six months he has experienced cramps in his feet and hands.  He describes that the foot cramps are much more notable than the hand ones.  He reports that he develops muscle contractions of his toes on both feet.  These occur exclusively at night.  They may occur about three times per week.  When he develops these cramps, he stands up to relieve the discomfort.  He notices that the toes are in an extended position.  He steps on the ground and they seem to "pop into place."  He develops calf pain after he experiences the cramp.  Sometimes they awaken him from his sleep.,He also has developed cramps in his hands although they are less severe and less frequent than those in his legs.  These do not occur at night and are completely random.  He notices that his thumb assumes a flexed position and sometimes he needs to pry it open to relieve the cramp.,He has never had any symptoms like this in the past.  He started taking Bactrim about nine months ago.  He had taken this in the past briefly, but has never taken it as long as he has now.  He cannot think of any other possible contributing factors to his symptoms.,He has a history of HIV for 21 years.  He was taking antiretroviral medications, but stopped about six or seven years ago.  He reports that he was unable to tolerate the medications due to severe stomach upset.  He has a CD4 count of 326.  He states that he has never developed AIDS.  He is considering resuming antiretroviral treatment.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has diabetes, but this is well controlled.  He also has hepatitis C and HIV.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , He takes insulin and Bactrim.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He lives alone.  He recently lost his partner.  This happened about six months ago.  He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use.  He is now retired.  He is very active and walks about four miles every few days.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His father and mother had diabetes.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 130/70

EXAM:,  Ultrasound-guided paracentesis,HISTORY: , Ascites.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were thoroughly explained.  Ultrasound demonstrates free fluid in the abdomen.  The area of interest was localized with ultrasonography.  The region was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic was administered.  A 5-French Yueh catheter needle combination was taken.  Upon crossing into the peritoneal space and aspiration of fluid, the catheter was advanced out over the needle.  A total of approximately 5500 mL of serous fluid was obtained.  The catheter was then removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications.,IMPRESSION: , Ultrasound-guided paracentesis as above.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Severe back pain and sleepiness.,The patient is not a good historian and history was obtained from the patient's husband at bedside.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old obese Caucasian female with past medical conditions that includes hypertension, history of urinary incontinence, dementia, and chronic back pain, basically brought by the husband to the emergency room because of having excruciating back pain.  As per the husband, the patient has this back pain for about almost 1 year and seeing Dr. X in Neurosurgery and had an epidural injection x2, and then the patient's pain somewhat got better between, but last time the patient went to see Dr. X, the patient given injection and the patient passed out, so the doctor stopped giving any other epidural injection.  The patient has severe pain and all in all, the patient cries at home.  As per the husband, the patient woke up in the morning with severe pain, unable to eat, drink today, and crying in the morning, so brought her to the emergency room for further evaluation.  The patient denied any history of fever, cough, chest pain, diarrhea, dysuria or polyuria.  While I was examining the patient, the patient explained about possible diagnosis and treatment plan and possible nursing home discharge for pain control.  The patient passed out for about 3 to 4 minutes, unable to respond to even painful stimuli.  The patient's heart rate went down to 50s and blood pressure was 92 systolic, so the patient was later on given IV fluid and blood pressure checked.  The patient woke up after 5 to 6 minutes, so the patient was later on evaluated for admission because of near syncopal episode.,PAST MEDICAL CONDITIONS:,  Include hypertension, dementia, urinary incontinence, chronic back pain, and degenerative joint disease of the spine.  No history of diabetes, stroke or coronary artery disease.,SURGICAL HISTORY: , Include left total hip replacement many years ago, history of hysterectomy, and appendectomy in the young age.,ALLERGIES: , DENIED.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , According to the list shows the patient takes hydrocodone 10/325 mg every 6 hours, Flexeril 10 mg p.o. at bedtime, and Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. 4 times a day.  The patient also takes Neurontin 200 mg 3 times a day, propranolol 10 mg twice a day, oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. twice a day, Namenda 10 mg p.o. daily, and Aricept 10 mg p.o. daily.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She lives with her husband, usually walks with a walker and wheelchair-bound, does not walk much as per the husband knows.  No history of alcohol abuse or smoking.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Currently lying in the bed without apparent distress, very lethargic.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse rate of 55, blood pressure is 92/52, after IV fluid came up to 105/58.,CHEST:  Shows bilateral air entry present, clear to auscultate.,HEART:  S1 and S2 regular.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended, and nontender.,EXTREMITIES:  Shows the patient's straight leg raising to be only up to 30% causing the patient severe back pain.,IMAGING: , The patient's x-ray of the lumbosacral spine done shows there is a L1 compression fracture with some osteophyte formation in the lumbar spine suggestive of degenerative joint disease.,LABORATORY DATA: , The patient's lab test is not done currently, but previous lab test done in 3/2009 seems to be in acceptable range.,IMPRESSION: , The patient, because of near syncopal episode and polypharmacy, almost passed out for about 3 to 4 minutes in front of me with a low blood pressure.,1.  Vasovagal syncope versus polypharmacy because of 3 to 4 medications and muscle relaxants.,2.  Osteoporosis of the spine with L1 compression fracture causing the patient severe pain.,3.  Hypertension, now hypotension.,4.  Incontinence of the bladder.,5.  Dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.,PLAN AND SUGGESTION: , Initial plan was to send the patient to the nursing home, but because of the patient's low blood pressure and heart rate low, we will admit the patient to DOU for 23-hour observation, start the patient on IV fluid, normal saline, 20 mEq KCl, and Protonix 40 mg, and we will also continue the patient's Namenda and Aricept.  I will hold the patient's hydrocodone.  I will hold the Flexeril and I will also hold gabapentin at this moment.  We will give the patient's pain control with Percocet and very minimal morphine sulfate as needed.  Also give the patient calcium with vitamin D and physical therapy.  We will also order a blood test and further management will be based on the patient's all test results.  I also explained to the husband that tomorrow if the patient is better and more alert and awake, then we will send her to the nursing care versus home, it depends on the pain control.
ACNE VULGARIS,, commonly referred to as just acne, is a chronic inflammation of the skin that occurs most often during adolescence but can occur off and on throughout life.  The skin eruptions most often appear on the face, chest, back and upper arms and are more common in males than females.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Blackheads the size of a pinhead.,*  Whiteheads similar to blackheads.,*  Pustules - lesions filled with pus.,*  Redness and inflamed skin.,*  Cysts - large, firm swollen lesions in severe acne.,*  Abscess - infected lesion that is swollen, tender, inflamed, filled with pus, also seen in severe acne.,CAUSES:,Oil glands in the skin become plugged for reasons unknown but during adolescence, sex-hormone changes play some role.  When oil backs up in the plugged gland, a bacteria normally present on skin causes an infection.  Acne is NOT caused by foods, uncleanliness or masturbation.  Cleaning the skin can decrease its severity but sexual activity has no effect on it.  A family history of acne can indicate if an individual will get acne and how severe it might be.  Currently, acne can't be prevented.,ACNE CAN BE BROUGHT ON OR MADE WORSE BY:,*  Hot or cold temperatures.,*  Emotional stress.,*  Oily skin.,*  Endocrine (hormone) disorder.,*  Drugs such as cortisones, male hormones, or oral contraceptives.,*  Some cosmetics.,*  Food sensitivities.  Again, foods do not cause acne but some certain ones may make it worse.  To discover any food sensitivities, eliminate suspicious foods from your diet and then start eating them again one at a time.  If acne worsens 2-3 days after consumption, then avoid this food.  Acne usually improves in summer so some foods may be tolerated in summer that can't be eaten in winter.,TREATMENT:,*  Most cases of acne respond well to treatment and will likely disappear once adolescence is over.  Even with adequate treatment, acne will tend to flare up from time to time and sometimes permanent facial scars or pitting of the skin may occur.,*  If your skin is oily, gently clean face with a fresh, clean wash cloth using unscented soap for 3- 5 minutes; an antibacterial soap may work better.  A previously used wet washcloth will harbor bacteria.  Don't aggressively scrub tender lesions as this may spread infection; be gentle.  Rinse the soap off for a good 1-2 minutes.  Dry face carefully with a clean towel and use an astringent such as rubbing alcohol that will remove the skin oil.,OTHER TIPS THAT MAY HELP ACNE:,*  Shampoo hair at least twice a week.  Keep hair off of face even while sleeping as hair can spread oil and bacteria.  If you have dandruff, use a dandruff shampoo.  Avoid cream hair rinses.,*  Wash sweat and skin oil off as soon as possible after sweating and exercising.,*  Use thinner, water-based cosmetics instead of the heavier oil-based ones.,*  Avoid skin moisturizers unless recommended by your doctor.,*  Do not squeeze, pick, rub or scratch your skin or the acne lesions.  This may damage the skin causing scarring and delay healing of acne.  Only a doctor should remove blackheads.,*  Keep from resting face on hands while reading, studying or watching TV.,*  Try to avoid pressing the phone receiver on you chin while talking on the phone.,*  Ultraviolet light may be a treatment recommended by your doctor but this is by no means a license to sunbathe!  Don't use the sun to treat acne.,*  Dermabrasion may be another option to treat acne scars.  This is a type of cosmetic surgery to help remove unsightly scars.,MEDICATIONS THAT MAY BE PRESCRIBED TO HELP ACNE INCLUDE:,*  Oral or topical antibiotics.,*  Cortisone injections into acne lesions.,*  Oral contraceptives.,*  Tretinoin, which may increase sun sensitivity and excessive dryness,  is not recommended during pregnancy.,*  Accutane (isotretinoin) is a powerful drug to treat acne but causes birth defects.  A woman taking this drug,must be on two types of birth control and have negative pregnancy tests.  This drug also increases sun,sensitivity.  Other more serious side effects can occur and your doctor will discuss those with you if Accutane is to be prescribed.,TETRACYCLINE:,Tetracycline is a very safe antibiotic.  It is not related to penicillin and an allergy to it is unusual.  There are several potential side effects:,1.  Tetracycline can cause nausea or heartburn.,2.  Tetracycline can cause vaginitis.,3.  Tetracycline can cause excessive sun burn.,CAUTIONS ON TETRACYCLINE:,1.  Do not take Tetracycline with milk or milk products (ice cream, cheese, yogurt, etc.).  This will cancel out the Tetracycline.  Separate the Tetracycline from these products by one and one-half hours before and after each capsule.  Do have a small amount of non milk-containing food in your stomach first to prevent nausea.,2.  Do not take Tetracycline if you are pregnant.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 48-year-old black male with stage IV chronic kidney disease, likely secondary to HIV nephropathy who presents to clinic for followup having missed prior clinic appointments.  He was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X.  This is the first time that I have met the patient.  The patient's history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an HIV-associated complication.  He is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for approximately one year.  He had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3.  When he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his HAART regimen.  Since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his HIV and is seeing Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic.  He is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy.  His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350.  He has had no HIV complications since he was last seen in our clinic.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic, here in ABCD, although he has not seen her in approximately one year.  The patient has an AV fistula that was placed in late 2006.  The latest blood work that I have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a GFR of 22 and a potassium of 5.9.  These laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation.  The only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping.  He was given Ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Open calcaneus fracture on the right.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Open calcaneus fracture on the right.,PROCEDURES:,  ,1.  Irrigation and debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and bone associated with an open fracture.,2.  Placement of antibiotic-impregnated beads.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,FINDINGS:,  Healing skin with no gross purulence identified, some fibrinous material around the beads.,SUMMARY:,  After informed consent was obtained and verified, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, her right leg was sterilely prepped and draped in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was inflated and the previous wound was opened.  Dr. X came in to look at the wound and the beads were removed, all 25 beads were extracted, and pulsatile lavage, and curette, etc., were used to debride the wound.  The wound margins were healthy with the exception of very central triangular incision area.  The edges were debrided and then 19 antibiotic-impregnated beads with gentamicin and tobramycin were inserted and the wound was further closed today.,The skin edges were approximated under minimal tension.  The soft dressing was placed.  An Ace was placed.  She was awakened from the anesthesia and taken to recovery room in a stable condition.  Final needle, instrument, and sponge counts were correct.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint.,2.  Closed reduction casting of the right forearm.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , On the left was 29 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.  The father was made aware of the intraoperative findings.  All questions answered.

Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the upper and lower left quadrants and extraction of teeth was begun on the upper left quadrant teeth numbers 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 were removed with elevators and forceps extraction.  Moving to the lower quadrant on the left side, tooth numbers 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 were removed with elevators and routine forceps extraction.  The flaps were then closed with 3-0 gut sutures and upon completion of the two quadrants on the left side, the endotracheal tube was then relocated from the right side to the left side for access to the quadrants on the right.  Teeth numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 were then removed with elevators and routine forceps extraction.  It was noted that tooth #6 was missing, could not be seen whether tooth #6 was palately impacted, but the tooth was not encountered.  On the lower right quadrant, teeth numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 were removed with elevators and routine forceps extraction.  Tooth #32 was partially bony impacted, but exposed, so it was removed by removing bone on buccal aspect with high-speed drill with a round bur.  Tooth was then luxated from the socket.  The flaps were then closed on both quadrants with 3-0 gut sutures.  The area was irrigated thoroughly with normal saline solution and a total of 8.5 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100, 000 epinephrine and 3.6 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200, 000.  Upon completion of the procedure, the throat pack was removed.  The pharynx was suctioned.  An oral gastric tube was passed and small amount of stomach contents were suctioned.  The patient was then extubated and taken to PACU in stable condition.

He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound.  He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair.  For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines.  He has fullness in the back of his wound.  The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak.  The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics.  The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level.  Full-thickness skin flaps were developed.  It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid.  Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal.  Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements.  It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1.  It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis.  Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately.  Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left.  Complete laminectomy at L3 was done.  Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen.  Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made.  There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation.  The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl.  After this the standard starting point was made.  Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  The screws were subsequently placed.  Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws.  Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1.  This was done on the right side first.  The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5.  Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4.  Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side.  Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately.  Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5.,Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette.  Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix.  This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters.  DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately.  Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound.  Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1.  Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately.  Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape.  The drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition.  No complications arose.

We have discussed locations, the nature of trigonocephaly's repair, metopic synostosis repair with bilateral fronto-orbital advancement, forehead reconstruction, and bone graft.  We have discussed risks and benefits.  Risks included, but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgeries, minimal possibility of death, the alternatives, devastating bleeding, anesthesia, death, dehiscence, infection.  The parents understand, decide to proceed with surgery.  Informed consent was obtained and we proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given.  Lines were placed by Anesthesia and then the head of the bed was turned to 100 degrees.  The patient was once more positioned and padded in the usual manner.  The incision was marked with the help of a marking pen and local anesthetic was infiltrated after prepping the area one time, then the definitive prep and draping of the area was done.,The procedure began with an incision through the full-thickness of the skin into the subcutaneous tissue down to the subgaleal plane.  The subgaleal plane was developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery.  Raney clips were applied to both flaps to prevent significant bleeding.  Then, we proceed with craniotomy part and Dr. Y proceeded with this part of the procedure.  I assisted her and this will be described in a different operative report.  Then, the area corresponding to the C-shaped osteotomy was marked and then we proceed in conjunction with Dr. Y to develop these osteotomies with the help of the Midas by retracting the contents of the skull at the level of the anterior fossa as well as the orbital contents with the help of a ribbon retractor.  The osteotomies were done with the Midas and some irrigation.  There was an osteotomy done at the level of the frontozygomatic suture just posterior to the frontozygomatic suture and then these osteotomies continued down intraorbitally and lateral through the zygoma to the level of the intraorbital rim.  This was done on both sides.  Hemostasis achieved with bone wax and electrocautery.  Once the osteotomies were completed, __________ of the osteotomy sites allowed advancements.  On the left side, there was a minor fracture to the superior orbital rim that was plated.  The bone grafts were customized placing these at the level of the sphenoid bone in the posterior aspect of the orbital rim.  The temporalis muscle was advanced and attached to the orbital rim with holes that have been drilled with Midas and a 3-0 Vicryl interrupted stitches.  The forehead flaps were attached with the help of absorbable mesh.  The forehead portions were applied to the fronto-orbital advancement of fronto-orbital piece with the help of Synthes mesh and 3-mm screws.  Hemostasis was checked.  The flaps were retracted back into position.,The wound was closed with 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures, 4-0 Vicryl interrupted stitches, and 5-0 running fast absorbing gut.  Dressing was applied with Xeroform, bacitracin, and ABDs and a burn net.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were completed at the end of the procedure.
PROCEDURE:,:  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline.  The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised.  A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges.  The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen.  A pneumoperitoneum was established.  After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted.  Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision.  An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area.  Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left.  The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally.  The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally.  Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder.  The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up.  The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot.  After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally.  Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided.  An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained.  This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects.  The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized.  The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was then divided using scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery.  The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site.  The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned.  All dissection areas were inspected.  They were hemostatic.  There was not any bile leakage.  All clips were in place.  The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry.  All ports were then removed under direct vision.  The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate.  The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch.  All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient is currently being aroused from general endotracheal anesthesia.  I was present during the entire case.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hammertoe deformity, left fifth digit.,2.  Ulceration of the left fifth digit plantolaterally.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Hammertoe deformity, left fifth toe.,2.  Ulceration of the left fifth digit plantolaterally.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroplasty of the left fifth digit proximal interphalangeal joint laterally.,2.  Excision of plantar ulceration of the left fifth digit 3 cm x 1 cm in size.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient is a 38-year-old female with longstanding complaint of painful hammertoe deformity of her left fifth toe.  The patient had developed ulceration plantarly after being scheduled for removal of a plantar mass in the same area.  The patient elects for surgical removal of this ulceration and correction of her hammertoe deformity at this time.,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted to the OR where the patient was placed on the Operating Room table in the supine position.  After adequate amount of IV sedation was administered by Anesthesia Department, the patient was given a digital block to the left fifth toe using 0.5% Marcaine plain with 1% lidocaine plain in 1:1 mixture totaling 6 cc.  Following this, the patient was draped and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  An ankle tourniquet was placed on the left ankle and the left foot was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 230 mmHg and then was brought back down to the level of the table.  The stockinette was then cut and reflected and held in place using towel clamp.,The skin was then cleansed using the wet and dry Ray-Tec sponge and then the plantar lesion was outlined.  The lesion measured 1 cm in diameter at the level of the skin and a 3 cm elliptical incision line was drawn on the surface of the skin in the plantolateral aspect of the left fifth digit.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, skin incision was made.  Following this, the incision was then deepened using a fresh #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the skin was reflected distally and proximally to the lesion.  The lesion appeared well encapsulated with fibrous tissue and through careful dissection using combination of sharp and drill instrumentation the ulceration was removed in its entirety.  The next further exploration was performed to ensure that no residual elements of the fibrous capsular tissue remained within.  The lesion extended from the level of the skin down to the periosteal tissue of the middle and distal phalanx, however, did not show any evidence of extending beyond the level of a periosteum.  Remaining tissues were inspected and appeared healthy.  The lesion was placed in the specimen container and sent to pathology for microanalysis as well as growth.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left fifth digit and using further dissection with a #15 blade, the periosteum was reflected off the lateral aspect of the proximal ________ median phalanx.  The capsule was also reflected to expose the prominent lateral osseous portion of this joint.  Using a sagittal saw and #139 blade, the lateral osseous prominence was resected.  This was removed in entirety.  Then using power-oscillating rasp, the sharp edges were smoothed and recontoured to the desirable anatomic condition.  Then the incision and wound was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline with gentamycin.  Following this, the bone was inspected and appeared to be healthy with no evidence of involvement from the removed aforementioned lesion.,Following this, using #4-0 nylon in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures, the lesion wound was closed and skin was approximated well without tension to the surface skin.  Following this, the incision site was dressed using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Coban in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was then deflated and hyperemia was noted to return to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then escorted from the operative table into the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was brought to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  In the recovery, the patient was given a surgical shoe as well as given instructions for postoperative care to include rest ice and elevation as well as the patient was given prescription for Naprosyn 250 mg to be taken three times daily as well as Vicodin ES to be taken q.6h. as needed.,The patient will follow-up on Friday with Dr. X in office for further evaluation.  The patient was also given instructions as to signs of infection and to monitor her operative site.  The patient was instructed to keep daily dressings intact, clean, dry, and to not remove them.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.,2. Right femoral selective angiogram.,3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: ,The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.,After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month. We will also plan to perform a carotid duplex Doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits.

He developed left heel abscess.  He had previous debridements, developed a calcaneal fracture and has now had several debridement with placement of the antibiotic beads.  After re-inspecting the wound last week, the plan was for possible debridement and he desired below-the-knee amputation.  We are going to change the dressing on the right side also.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery were discussed.  The risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, persistent wound healing problems, and the need for future surgery.  He understood all the risks and desired operative treatment.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After appropriate informed consent obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  General anesthesia induced.  Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, cast padding placed on the left proximal thigh and tourniquet was applied.  The right leg was redressed.  I took the dressing down.  There was a small bit of central drainage, but it was healing nicely.  Adaptic and new sterile dressings were applied.,The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,A transverse incision made about the mid shaft of the tibia.  A long posterior flap was created.  It was taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery.  Please note that tourniquet had been inflated after exsanguination of the limb.  Superficial peroneal nerve identified, clamped, and cut.  Anterior compartment was divided.  The anterior neurovascular bundle identified, clamped, and cut.  The plane was taken between the deep and superficial compartments.  The superficial compartment was reflected posteriorly.  Tibial nerve identified, clamped, and cut.  Tibial vessels identified, clamped, and cut.,Periosteum of the tibia elevated proximally along with the fibula.  The tibia was then cut with Gigli saw.  It was beveled anteriorly and smoothed down with a rasp.  The fibula was cut about a cm and a half proximal to this using a large bone cutter.  The remaining posterior compartment was divided.  The peroneal bundle identified, clamped, and cut.  The leg was then passed off of the field.  Each vascular bundle was then doubly ligated with 0 silk stick tie and 0 silk free tie.  The nerves were each pulled at length, injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine, cut, and later retracted proximally.  The tourniquet was released.  Good bleeding from the tissues and hemostasis obtained with electrocautery.  Copious irrigation performed using antibiotic-impregnated solution.  A one-eighth-inch Hemovac drain placed in the depth of wound adhering on the medial side.  A gastroc soleus fascia brought up and attached to the anterior fascia and periosteum with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The remaining fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with 2-0 PDS suture using 2-0 Monocryl suture in interrupted fashion.  Skin closed with skin staples.  Xeroform gauze, 4 x 4, and a padded soft dressing applied.  He was placed in a well-padded anterior and posterior slab splint with the knee in extension.  He was then awakened, extubated, and taken to recovery in stable condition.  There were no immediate operative complications, and he tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Chondromalacia patella.,2.  Patellofemoral malalignment syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Grade-IV chondromalacia patella.,2.  Patellofemoral malalignment syndrome.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Diagnostic arthroscopy with partial chondroplasty of patella.,2.  Lateral retinacular release.,3.  Open tibial tubercle transfer with fixation of two 4.5 mm cannulated screws.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , Approximately 70 minutes at 325 mmHg.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Grade-IV chondromalacia noted to the central and lateral facet of the patella.  There was a grade II to III chondral changes to the patellar groove.  The patella was noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle.  The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen.  The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact.  Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  She has failed conservative therapy.  It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions.  Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris.  Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal.  An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal.  A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  Next, the knee was suctioned dry.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery.  The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision.  The patellar tendon was identified.  The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin.  Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  There was excellent fixation noted.  The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella.  The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl.  Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture.  Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities.  She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension.  It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.  She was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.,Prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint.  She will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right renal mass.,2.  Hematuria.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right renal mass.,2.  Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Cystourethroscopy.,2.  Right retrograde pyelogram.,3.  Right ureteral pyeloscopy.,4.  Right renal biopsy.,5.  Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement.,ANESTHESIA: , Sedation.,SPECIMEN: , Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies.,INDICATION:,  The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria.  He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.  The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis.  The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room.  It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.  He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.
CLINICAL HISTORY: ,This 78-year-old black woman has a history of hypertension, but no other cardiac problems. She noted complaints of fatigue, lightheadedness, and severe dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated by her PCP on January 31st and her ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 37 beats per minute. She has had intermittent severe sinus bradycardia alternating with a normal sinus rhythm, consistent with sinoatrial exit block, and she is on no medications known to cause bradycardia. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70% without significant valvular heart disease.,PROCEDURE:, Implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker.,APPROACH:, Left cephalic vein.,LEADS IMPLANTED: ,Medtronic model 12345 in the right atrium, serial number 12345. Medtronic 12345 in the right ventricle, serial number 12345.,DEVICE IMPLANTED: ,Medtronic EnRhythm model 12345, serial number 12345.,LEAD PERFORMANCE: ,Atrial threshold less than 1.3 volts at 0.5 milliseconds.

Impedance 855.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 20 mL.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state and intravenous sedation was provided as needed with Versed and fentanyl. The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.,IMPRESSION: ,Successful implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker via the left cephalic vein. The patient will be observed overnight and will go home in the morning.
REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup circumcision.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient had his circumcision performed on 09/16/2007 here at Children's Hospital.  The patient had a pretty significant phimosis and his operative course was smooth.  He did have a little bit of bleeding when he woke in recovery room, which required placement of some additional sutures, but after that, his recovery has been complete.  His mom did note that she had to him a couple of days of oral analgesics, but he seems to be back to normal and pain free now.  He is having no difficulty urinating, and his bowel function remains normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,Today, The patient looks healthy and happy.  We examined his circumcision site.  His Monocryl sutures are still in place.  The healing is excellent, and there is only a mild amount of residual postoperative swelling.  There was one area where he had some recurrent adhesions at the coronal sulcus, and I gently lysed this today and applied antibiotic ointment showing this to mom had to especially lubricate this area until the healing is completed.,IMPRESSION: , Satisfactory course after circumcision for severe phimosis with no perioperative complications.,PLAN:  ,The patient came in followup for his routine care with Dr. X, but should not need any further routine surgical followup unless he develops any type of difficulty with this surgical wound.  If that does occur, we will be happy to see him back at any time.,

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy.,PROCEDURE:, Redo L4-5 diskectomy left.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,ANTIBIOTIC (S),: Vancomycin given preoperatively.,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 10 mL.,BLOOD REPLACED:, None.,CRYSTALLOID GIVEN:, 800 mL.,DRAIN (S):, None.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied. The skin had been infiltrated with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.,After a sterile dressing was applied, the patient was turned into the supine position on the waiting recovery room stretcher, brought from under the effects of anesthesia, and taken to the recovery room.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute appendicitis with perforation.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Acute appendicitis with perforation.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic appendectomy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 4-year-old little boy, who has been sick for several days and was seen in our Emergency Department yesterday where a diagnosis of possible constipation was made, but he was sent home with a prescription for polyethylene glycol but became more acutely ill and returned today with tachycardia, high fever and signs of peritonitis.  A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation.  He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process.  He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.,I met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options.  All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion.  We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure.  A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia.  CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.,There was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum.  After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix.  In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix.  The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port.  I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system.  When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible.  The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis, left knee with varus deformity.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis, left knee with varus deformity.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Left total knee cemented arthroplasty.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal with Duramorph.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,50 mL.,NEEDLE AND SPONGE COUNT:,  Correct.,SPECIMENS: , None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,Approximately 77 minutes.,IMPLANTS USED:,1.  Zimmer NexGen posterior stabilized LPS-Flex GSF femoral component size D, left.,2.  All-poly patella, size 32/8.5 mm thickness.,3.  Prolong highly cross-linked polyethylene 12 mm.,4.  Stemmed tibial component, size 2.,5.  Palacos cement with antibiotics x2 batches.,INDICATION: , The patient is an 84-year-old female with significant endstage osteoarthritis of the left knee, who has had rapid progression with pain and disability.  Surgery was indicated to relieve her pain and improve her functional ability.  Goal objectives and the procedure were discussed with the patient.  Risks and benefits were explained.  No guarantees have been made or implied.  Informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and once an adequate spinal anesthesia with Duramorph was achieved, her left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed proximally in the thigh.  Antibiotics were infused prior to Foley catheter insertion.  Time-out procedure was called.,A straight longitudinal anterior midline incision was made.  Dissection was carried down sharply down the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the fascia.  Deep fascia was exposed.  The tourniquet was inflated at 300 mmHg prior to the skin incision.  A standard medial parapatellar approach was made.  The quadriceps tendon was incised approximately 1 cm from the vastus medialis insertion.  Incision was then carried down distally and distal arthrotomy was completed.  Patellar tendon was well protected.  Retinaculum and capsule was incised approximately 5 mm from the medial border of the patella for later repair.  The knee was exposed very well.  Significant tricompartmental osteoarthritis was noted.  The osteophytes were removed with a rongeur.  Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were excised.  Medial and lateral meniscectomies were performed.  Medial dissection was performed subperiosteally along the medial aspect of the proximal tibia to address the varus deformity.  The medial compartment was more affected than lateral.  Medial ligaments were tied.  Retropatellar fat pad was excised.  Osteophytes were removed.  Using a Cobb elevator, the medial soft tissue periosteum envelope was well reflected.,Attention was placed for the preparation of the femur.  The trochlear notch was ossified.  A rongeur was utilized to identify the notch and then using an intramedullary drill guide, a starting hole was created slightly anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior portal was 1 cm anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior femoral sizer was positioned keeping 3 degrees of external rotation.  Rotation was also verified using the transepicondylar axis and Whiteside line.  The pins were positioned in the appropriate holes.  Anterior femoral cut was performed after placing the cutting guide.  Now, the distal cutting guide was attached to the alignment and 5 degrees of valgus cut was planned.  A distal femoral cut was made which was satisfactory.  A sizer was positioned which was noted to be D.  The 5-in-1 cutting block size D was secured with spring pins over the resected bone.  Using an oscillating saw, cuts were made in a sequential manner such as anterior condyle, posterior condyle, anterior chamfer, and posterior chamfer.  Then using a reciprocating saw, intercondylar base notch cut and side cuts were made.  Following this, the cutting block for High-Flex knee was positioned taking 2 mm of additional posterior condyle.  Using a reciprocating saw, the side cuts were made and bony intercondylar notch cut was completed.  The bone with its attached soft tissue was removed.  Once the femoral preparation was completed, attention was placed for the preparation of the tibia.  The medial and the lateral collateral ligaments were well protected with a retractor.  The PCL retractor was positioned and the tibia was translated anteriorly.  Osteophytes were removed.  The extramedullary tibial alignment guide was affixed to the tibia and appropriate amount of external rotation was considered reference to the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  Similarly, horseshoe alignment guide was positioned and the alignment guide was well aligned to the distal 1/3rd of the crest of the tibia as well as the 2nd toe.  Once the alignment was verified in a coronal plane, the tibial EM guide was well secured and then posterior slope was also aligned keeping the alignment rod parallel to the tibial crest.  A built-in 7-degree posterior slope was considered with instrumentation.  Now, the 2 mm stylus arm was positioned over the cutting block medially, which was the most affected site.  Tibial osteotomy was completed 90 degrees to the mechanical axis in the coronal plane.  The resected thickness of the bone was satisfactory taken 2 mm from the most affected site.  The resected surface shows some sclerotic bone medially.  Now, attention was placed for the removal of the posterior osteophytes from the femoral condyle.  Using curved osteotome, angle curette, and a rongeur, the posterior osteophytes were removed.  Now, attention was placed for confirming the flexion-extension gap balance using a 10 mm spacer block in extension and 12 mm in flexion.  Rectangular gap was achieved with appropriate soft tissue balance in both flexion and extension.  The 12 mm spacer block was satisfactory with good stability in flexion and extension.,Attention was now placed for completion of the tibia.  Size 2 tibial trial plate was positioned.  Appropriate external rotation was maintained with the help of the horseshoe alignment rod.  Reference to the tibial crest distally and 2nd toe was considered as before.  The midpoint of the trial tray was collinear with the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  The rotation of tibial plate was satisfactory as required and the preparation of the tibia was completed with intramedullary drill followed by broach impactor.  At this point, trial femoral and tibial components were reduced using a 12 mm trial liner.  The range of motion and stability in both flexion and extension was satisfactory.  No further soft tissue release was indicated.  I was able to achieve 0 degrees of extension and complete flexion of the knee.,Attention was now placed for the preparation of the patella.  Using a patellar caliper, the thickness was measured to be 21.5 mm.  This gives an ideal resection of 8.5 mm keeping 13 mm of bone intact.  Reaming was initiated with a patellar reamer reaming up to 13 mm with the reaming alignment guide.  Using a caliper, the resected patella was measured, which was noted to be 13 mm.  A 32 sizer was noted to accommodate the resected surface very well.  Drilling was completed and trial 32 button was inserted without any difficulty.  The tracking was satisfactory.  There was no evidence of any subluxation or dislocation of the patella.  The trial components position was satisfactory.  The alignment and the rotation of all 3 components were satisfactory.  All the trial components were removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac lavage irrigation mechanical system.  The resected surfaces were dried with a sponge.  Two batches of Palacos cement were mixed.  The cementing was initiated starting with tibia followed by femur and patella.  Excess peripheral cement were removed with the curette and knife.  The knee was positioned in extension with a 12 mm trial liner.  Patellar clamp was placed after cementing the all-poly patella.  Once the cement was set hard and cured, tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The trial 12 mm liner was replaced with definitive Prolong highly cross-linked polyethylene liner.  Range of motion and stability was verified at 0 degrees and flexion of 120 degrees.  Anterior-posterior drawer test was satisfactory.  Medial and lateral stability was satisfactory.  Patellar tracking was satisfactory.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  A local cocktail was injected, which included the mixture of 0.25% plain Marcaine, 30 mg of Toradol, and 4 mg of morphine.  The quadriceps mechanism and distal arthrotomy was repaired with #1 Vicryl in figure-of-8 fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl and 0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl proximally.  The skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.  She tolerated the procedure very well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Torn rotator cuff, right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Torn rotator cuff, right shoulder.,2.  Subacromial spur with impingement syndrome, right shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Diagnostic arthroscopy with subacromial decompression.,2.  Open repair of rotator cuff using three Panalok suture anchors.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Approximately 200 cc.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , There was noted to be a full thickness tear to the supraspinatus tendon at the insertion of the greater tuberosity.  There is moderate amount of synovitis noted throughout the glenohumeral joint.  There is a small subacromial spur noted on the very anterolateral border of the acromion.,HISTORY: , This is a 62-year-old female who previously underwent a repair of rotator cuff.  She continued to have pain within the shoulder.  She had a repeat MRI performed, which confirmed the clinical diagnosis of re-tear of the rotator cuff.  She wished to proceed with a repair.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the above treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 08/21/03, she was taken to the Operative Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  She was placed in the modified beachchair position.  Her upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in the posterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint.  A camera was placed in the joint and was insufflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained and the above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated anteriorly.  Through this a probe was placed and the intraarticular structures were palpated and found to be intact.  A tear of the inner surface of the rotator cuff was identified.  The camera was then taken to the subacromial space.  A straight lateral portal was also used and a shaver was placed into the subacromial space.  Further debridement of the anterolateral border of the acromion was performed to remove evidence of the subacromial spur, which had reformed.  The edges of the rotator cuff were then debrided.  The camera was then removed and the shoulder was suction and dried.  A lateral incision was made over the anterolateral border of the acromion.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The deltoid musculature was then incised and aligned with its fibers exposing the rotator cuff tear and the edges were further debrided using a rongeur.  A trough was then made in the greater tuberosity using the rongeur.  Two Panalok anchors were then placed within the trough and weaved through the suture and third Panalok anchor was placed medial to the trough and weaved through the rotator cuff.  The ends of the suture were tied down from the fixating the rotator cuff within the trough.  The rotator cuff was then further oversewed using the Panalok suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and it was then suction dried.  The deltoid muscle was reapproximated using #1 Vicryl.  A continuous infusion pump catheter was placed into the subacromial space to help with postoperative pain control.  The subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity.  She was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient was guarded.  She will begin pendulum exercises postoperative day #3.  She will follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for reevaluation.  Physical therapy initiated approximately six weeks postoperatively.
BLEPHAROPLASTY,The patient was prepped and draped.  The upper lid skin was marked out in a lazy S fashion, and the redundant skin marked out with a Green forceps.  Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.  The patient was given 50 mg of Demerol IM with 25 mg of Phenergan.
EXAM:,MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE,CLINICAL:,Pain.,FINDINGS:,The bone marrow demonstrates normal signal intensity. There is no evidence of bone contusion or fracture. There is no evidence of joint effusion. Tendinous structures surrounding the ankle joint are intact. No abnormal mass or fluid collection is seen surrounding the ankle joint.,IMPRESSION,: NORMAL MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE.
HISTORY: , The patient is a 67-year-old female, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety.  At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my services at this time due to a plateau in her progress.  Numerous home activities were recommended to allow her to continue to make progress at home.
SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,  Respiratory distress syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, retinal immaturity.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: , The baby is an ex-32 weeks small for gestational age infant with birth weight 1102.  Baby was born at ABCD Hospital at 1333 on 07/14/2006.  Mother is a 20-year-old gravida 1, para 0 female who received prenatal care.  Prenatal course was complicated by low amniotic fluid index and hypertension.  She was evaluated for evolving preeclampsia and had a C-section secondary to the nonreassuring fetal status.  Baby delivered operatively, Apgar scores were 8 and 9 initially taken to level 2 satellite nursery and arrangements were to transfer to Children's Hospital.  Infant was transferred to Children's Hospital for higher level of care, stayed at Children's Hospital for approximately 2 weeks, and was transferred back to ABCD where he stayed until he was discharged on 08/16/2006.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , At the time of transfer to ABCD, these were the following issues.,FEEDING AND NUTRITION: , Baby was on TPN and p.o. feeds had been started and were advanced 1 ml q.6h.  Baby was tolerating p.o. feeds of expressed breast milk and baby began to experience some abdominal distention.  The p.o. feeds were held and IV D10 water was given.  Baby was started on Mylicon drops and glycerin suppositories.  Abdominal ultrasound showed gaseous distention without signs of obstruction.  OG tube was passed.  Baby improved after couple of days when p.o. feedings were restarted.  Baby was also given Reglan.  At the time of discharge, baby was tolerating p.o. feeds well of BM fortified with 22-cal NeoSure.  Feeding amounts at the time of discharge was between 35 to 50 mL per feed and weight was 1797 grams.,RESPIRATIONS: , At the time of admission, baby was not having any apnea spells, no bradycardia or desaturations, was saturating well on room air and continued to do well on room air until the time of discharge.,HYPOGLYCEMIA: , Baby began to experience hypoglycemic episodes on 07/24/2006.  Blood glucose level was as low as 46.  D10 was given initially as bolus.  Baby continued to experience hypoglycemic episodes.  Diazoxide was started 5 mg/kg per os every 8 hours and fingersticks were done to monitor blood glucose level.  The baby improved with diazoxide, hypoglycemic issues resolved and then began again.  Diazoxide was discontinued, but the hypoglycemic issues restarted.  The Diazoxide was restarted again.  Blood glucose level stabilized and then diazoxide was weaned off until daily dose of 6 mg/kg and then the diazoxide was discontinued.  At the time of discharge, blood glucose levels were not being stable for 24 hours.,CARDIOVASCULAR: , Infant was hemodynamically stable on admission from Madera.  Infant has a closed PDA.  Infant had two cardiac echograms done.

SUBJECTIVE:,  This is an 11-year-old female who comes in for two different things.  1.  She was seen by the allergist.  No allergies present, so she stopped her Allegra, but she is still real congested and does a lot of snorting.  They do not notice a lot of snoring at night though, but she seems to be always like that.  2.  On her right great toe, she has got some redness and erythema.  Her skin is kind of peeling a little bit, but it has been like that for about a week and a half now.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Otherwise reviewed and noted.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  None.,ALLERGIES TO MEDICINES:,  None.,FAMILY SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Everyone else is healthy at home.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She has been having the redness of her right great toe, but also just a chronic nasal congestion and fullness.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  Well-developed female, in no acute distress, afebrile.,HEENT:  Sclerae and conjunctivae clear.  Extraocular muscles intact.  TMs clear.  Nares patent.  A little bit of swelling of the turbinates on the left.  Oropharynx is essentially clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.,Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.,Chest:  Clear.,Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds and soft.,Dermatologic:  She has got redness along the lateral portion of her right great toe, but no bleeding or oozing.  Some dryness of her skin.  Her toenails themselves are very short and even on her left foot and her left great toe the toenails are very short.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  History of congestion, possibly enlarged adenoids, or just her anatomy.,2.  Ingrown toenail, but slowly resolving on its own.,PLAN:,1.  For the congestion, we will have ENT evaluate.  Appointment has been made with Dr. XYZ for in a couple of days.,2.  I told her just Neosporin for her toe, letting the toenail grow out longer.  Call if there are problems.
INDICATIONS:,  Ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post inferior wall myocardial infarction, status post left anterior descending PTCA and stenting.,PROCEDURE DONE:,  Adenosine Myoview stress test.,STRESS ECG RESULTS:,  The patient was stressed by intravenous adenosine, 140 mcg/kg/minute infused over four minutes.  The baseline resting electrocardiogram revealed an electronic pacemaker depolarizing the ventricles regularly at a rate of 70 beats per minute.  Underlying atrial fibrillation noted, very wide QRS complexes.  The heart rate remained unchanged at 70 beats per minute as the blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/70 with adenosine infusion.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Chronic plantar fasciitis, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Chronic plantar fasciitis, right foot.,PROCEDURE: , Open plantar fasciotomy, right foot.,ANESTHESIA: , Local infiltrate with IV sedation.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:,  The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems.  The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative care despite multiple attempts at conservative care.  The preoperative discussion with the patient including alternative treatment options, the procedure itself was explained, and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, falling arch, digital contracture, and the postoperative management were discussed.  The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point to interfere with normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was given 1 g Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following a light IV sedation, a posterior tibial nerve block and local infiltrate of the operative site was performed with 10 mL, and a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, and 0.25% Marcaine was affected.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balance anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE:, Plantar fasciotomy, right foot.  The plantar medial tubercle of the calcaneus was palpated and a vertical oblique incision, 2 cm in length with the distal aspect overlying the calcaneal tubercle was affected. Blunt dissection was carried out to expose the deep fascia overlying the abductor hallucis muscle belly and the medial plantar fascial band.  A periosteal elevator did advance laterally across the inferior aspect of the medial and central plantar fascial bands, creating a small and narrow soft tissue tunnel.  Utilizing a Metzenbaum scissor, transection of the medial two-third of the plantar fascia band began at the junction of the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle belly and medial plantar fascial band, extending to the lateral two-thirds of the band.  The lateral plantar fascial band was left intact.  Visualization and finger probe confirmed adequate transection.  The surgical site was flushed with normal saline irrigation.,The deep layer was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted with combination of 1 horizontal mattress and simples.  The dressing consisted of Adaptic, 4 x 4, conforming bandages, and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well, and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact.  A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient will be allowed to be full weightbearing to tolerance, in the boot to encourage physiological lengthening of the release of plantar fascial band.,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Keflex 500 mg 1 p.o. three times a day x10 days and Lortab 5 mg #40, 1 to 2 p.o. q.4-6 h. p.r.n. pain, 2 refills, along with written and oral home instructions.  After a short recuperative period, the patient was discharged home with vital signs stable and in no acute distress.

Enlarging superficial nevus 0.5 x 1 cm, right nasal ala.,TITLE OF PROCEDURES:,1.  Excision of left upper cheek skin neoplasm 0.5 x 1 cm with two layer closure.,2.  Excision of the left lower cheek skin neoplasm 0.5 x 1 cm with a two layer plastic closure.,3.  Shave excision of the right nasal ala 0.5 x 1 cm skin neoplasm.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Local.  I used a total of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 mL.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was evaluated preop and noted to be in stable condition.  Chart and informed consent were all reviewed preop.  All risks, benefits, and alternatives regarding the procedure have been reviewed in detail with the patient.  Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, recurrence of the lesion, need for further procedures have been all reviewed.  Each of these lesions appears to be benign nevi; however, they have been increasing in size.  The lesions involving the left upper and lower cheek appear to be deep.  These required standard excision with the smaller lesion of the right nasal ala being more superficial and amenable to a superficial shave excision.  Each of these lesions was marked.  The skin was cleaned with a sterile alcohol swab.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated.  Sterile prep and drape were then performed.,Began first excision of the left upper cheek skin lesion.  This was excised with the 15-blade full thickness.  Once it was removed in its entirety, undermining was performed, and the wound was closed with 5-0 myochromic for the deep subcutaneous, 5-0 nylon interrupted for the skin.,The lesion of the lower cheek was removed in a similar manner.  Again, it was excised with a 15 blade with two layer plastic closure.  Both these lesions appear to be fairly deep nevi.,The right nasal ala nevus was superficially shaved using the radiofrequency wave unit.  Each of these lesions was sent as separate specimens.  The patient was discharged from my office in stable condition.  He had minimal blood loss.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  Postop care instructions were reviewed in detail.  We have scheduled a recheck in one week and we will make further recommendations at that time.
PROCEDURE: , Endoscopy.,CLINICAL INDICATIONS: , Intermittent rectal bleeding with abdominal pain.,ANESTHESIA: , Fentanyl 100 mcg and 5 mg of IV Versed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position.  Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place.  After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty.  With swallowing, the scope was advanced down the esophagus into the body of the stomach.  The scope was further advanced down to the antrum and through the pylorus into the duodenum, which was visualized into its second portion.  It appeared free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration.  Samples were obtained from the antrum and prepyloric area to check for Helicobacter, rapid urease, and additional samples were sent to pathology.  Retroflexion view of the fundus of the stomach was normal without evidence of a hiatal hernia.  The scope was then slowly removed.  The distal esophagus appeared benign with a normal-appearing gastroesophageal sphincter and no esophagitis.  The remaining portion of the esophagus was normal.,IMPRESSION:,  Abdominal pain.  Symptoms most consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease without endoscopic evidence of hiatal hernia.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Await results of CLO testing and biopsies.  Return to clinic with Dr. Spencer in 2 weeks for further discussion.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux valgus, right foot.,2.  Hallux interphalangeus, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux valgus, right foot.,2.  Hallux interphalangeus, right foot.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Akin bunionectomy, right toe with internal wire fixation.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/local.,HISTORY:  ,This 51-year-old female presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for a surgery on her painful bunion through her right foot.  The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril.,After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion.  The foot was elevated off the table.  Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate.  Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved.  The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique.  Excellent rigid fixation was achieved.  A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight.  The temporary fixation was removed.  A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw.  The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done.,After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone.  A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved.  Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint.  The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches.  She is to follow with Dr. X.  She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise.  She was given prescription for Vicodin ES #25 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn one p.o. b.i.d.  500 mg.  She was discharged in stable condition.
OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.  This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.  The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch.  Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied.  The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
INDICATIONS:,  Dysphagia.,PREMEDICATION:,  Topical Cetacaine spray and Versed IV.,PROCEDURE:,:  The scope was passed into the esophagus under direct vision.  The esophageal mucosa was all unremarkable.  There was no evidence of any narrowing present anywhere throughout the esophagus and no evidence of esophagitis.  The scope was passed on down into the stomach.  The gastric mucosa was all examined including a retroflexed view of the fundus and there were no abnormalities seen.  The scope was then passed into the duodenum and the duodenal bulb and second and third portions of the duodenum were unremarkable.  The scope was again slowly withdrawn through the esophagus and no evidence of narrowing was present.  The scope was then withdrawn.,IMPRESSION:,  Normal upper GI endoscopy without any evidence of anatomical narrowing.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left breast mass.,2.  Hypertrophic scar of the left breast.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left breast mass.,2.  Hypertrophic scar of the left breast.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Excision of left breast mass and revision of scar.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Local with sedation.,SPECIMEN: , Scar with left breast mass.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient tolerated the procedure well and transferred to the recover room in stable condition.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is an 18-year-old female who presented to Dr. X's office.  The patient is status post left breast biopsy, which showed a fibrocystic disease with now a palpable mass just superior to the previous biopsy site.  The patient also has a hypertrophic scar.  Thus, the patient elected to undergo revision of the scar at the same time as an excision of the palpable mass.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , A hypertrophic scar was found and removed.  The cicatrix was removed in its entirety and once opening the wound, the area of tissue where the palpable mass was, was excised as well and sent to the lab.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent, risks, and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family, the patient was brought to the operating suite, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Elliptical incision was made over the previous cicatrix.  The total length of the incision was 5.5 cm.  Removing the cicatrix in its entirety with a #15 blade Bard-Parker scalpel after anesthetizing with local solution with 0.25% Marcaine.  Next, the area of tissue just inferior to the palpable mass, where the palpable was removed with electro Bovie cautery.  Hemostasis was maintained.  Attention was next made to approximating the deep dermal layers.  An interrupted #4-0 Vicryl suture was used and then a running subcuticular Monocryl suture was used to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips as well as bacitracin and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old gentleman, who works offshore as a cook, who about 4 days ago noted that he was having some swelling in his ankles and it progressively got worse over the past 3 to 4 days, until he was swelling all the way up to his mid thigh bilaterally.  He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.  He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.,General:  He was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles intact.,Neck:  Supple.  No JVD, adenopathy, or bruit.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without a rub.,Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.,Extremities:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis.  He did have 2+ pretibial edema in both lower extremities.,Neurologic:  No gross focal findings.,Skin:  Showed no active skin lesions.,LABORATORY DATA: , Sodium 138, potassium 6.1, chloride 108, CO2 22, glucose 116, BUN 111, creatinine 7.29, estimated GFR 10 mL/minute.  Calcium 7.4 with an albumin of 1.9.  Mag normal at 2.2.  Urine culture negative at 12 hours.  His Random urine sodium was low at 12.  Random urine protein was 4756, and creatinine in the urine was 538.  Urine drug screen was unremarkable.  Troponin was within normal limits.  Phosphorus slightly elevated at 5.7.  CPK level was 234, white blood cells 6.5, hemoglobin 12.2, platelet count 188,000 with 75% segs.  PT 10.0, INR 1.0, PTT at 27.3.  B-natriuretic peptide 718.  Urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 4+ blood, negative nitrites, and trace leukocytes, 5 to 10 wbc's, greater than 100 rbc's, occasional fine granular casts, and moderate transitional cells.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.,2.  Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with Kayexalate.,3.  Microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.,4.  Hypertension.,PLAN: , I will give him Kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  I will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to ABCD Center per the patient and his wife's request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  We will get a BMP, phosphorus, mag, CBC in the morning since he was given 80 mg of Lasix for fluid retention.  We will also give him 10 mg of Zaroxolyn p.o.  Discontinue all IV fluids.  Check an ANCA hepatitis profile, C3 and C4 complement levels along with CH 50 level.  I did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at Ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  I do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis.,I appreciate consult.  I did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.
PROCEDURE: , Medial branch rhizotomy, lumbosacral.,INFORMED CONSENT:,  The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,SEDATION: , The patient was given conscious sedation and monitored throughout the procedure.  Oxygenation was given.  The patient's oxygenation and vital signs were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.  Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs.,The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves.  Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at,*** volts.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts.,Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue.  After completion of each nerve block a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.  No complications.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.,DISCUSSION: , Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right carpal tunnel syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right carpal tunnel syndrome.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Right carpal tunnel release.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  IV sedation was supplied by the anesthesiologist.  A local block using 6 cc of 0.5% Marcaine was used at the transverse wrist crease using a 25 gauge needle, superficial to the transverse carpal ligament.,The upper extremity was exsanguinated with a 6 inch ace wrap.,Tourniquet time was less than 10 minutes at 250 mmHg.,An incision was used in line with the third web space just to the ulnar side of the thenar crease.  It was carried sharply down to the transverse wrist crease.  The transverse carpal ligament was identified and released under direct vision.  Proximal to the transverse wrist crease it was released subcutaneously.  During the entire procedure care was taken to avoid injury to the median nerve proper, the recurrent median, the palmar cutaneous branch, the ulnar neurovascular bundle and the superficial palmar arch.  The nerve appeared to be mildly constricted.  Closure was routine with running 5-0 nylon.  A bulky hand dressing as well as a volar splint was applied and the patient was sent to the outpatient surgery area in good condition.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 71-year-old Caucasian female with a history of diabetes, osteoarthritis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, diabetic foot ulcer, anemia and left lower extremity cellulitis. She was brought in by the EMS service to Erlanger emergency department with pulseless electrical activity. Her husband states that he was at home with his wife, when she presented to him complaining of fever and chills. She became acutely unresponsive. She was noted to have worsening of her breathing. She took several of her MDIs and then was placed on her CPAP. He went to notify EMS and when he returned, she was found to not be breathing. He stated that she was noted to have no breathing in excess of 10 minutes. He states that the EMS system arrived at the home and she was found not breathing. The patient was intubated at the scene and upon arrival to Erlanger Medical Center, she was found to have pupils fixed and dilated. She was seen by me in the emergency department and was on Neo-Synephrine, dopamine with a blood pressure of 97/22 with a rapid heart rate and again, in an unresponsive state.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Review of systems was not obtainable.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypertension, asthma, atrial fibrillation, diabetic foot ulcer and anemia.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, Noncontributory to above.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Mother with history of coronary artery disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient is married. She uses no ethanol, no tobacco and no illicits. She has a very support family unit.,MEDICATIONS:, Augmentin; Detrol LA; lisinopril.,IMMUNIZATIONS:, Immunizations were up to date for influenza, negative for Pneumovax.,ALLERGIES:, PENICILLIN.,LABORATORY AT PRESENTATION:, White blood cell count 11, hemoglobin 10.5, hematocrit 32.2, platelets 175,000. Sodium 148, potassium 5.2, BUN 30, creatinine 2.2 and glucose 216. PT was 22.4.,RADIOLOGIC DATA:, Chest x-ray revealed a diffuse pulmonary edema.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 97/52, pulse of 79, respirations 16, O2 sat 100%.,HEENT: The patient's pupils were again, fixed and dilated and intubated on the monitor.,CHEST: Poor air movement bilateral with bilateral rales.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN: The abdomen was obese, nondistended and nontender.,EXTREMITIES: Left diabetic foot had oozing pus drainage from the foot.,GU: Foley catheter was in place.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,1. Acute cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity with hypotensive shock and respiratory failure: Will continue ventilator support. Will rule out pulmonary embolus, rule out myocardial infarction. Continue pressors. The patient is currently on dopamine, Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.,2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Will continue ventilatory support.,3. Questionable sepsis: Will obtain blood cultures, intravenous vancomycin and Rocephin given.,4. Hypotensive shock: Will continue pressors. Will check random cortisol. Hydrocortisone was added.,Further inpatient management for this patient will be provided by Dr. R. The patient's status was discussed with her daughter and her husband. The husband states that his wife has been very ill in the past with multiple admissions, but he had never seen her as severely ill as with this event. He states that she completely was not breathing at all and he is aware of the severity of her illness and the gravity of her current prognosis. Will obtain the assistance with cardiology with this admission and will continue pressors and supportive therapy. The family will make an assessment and final decision concerning her long-term management after a 24 hour period.
She started her periods at age 13.  She is complaining of a three-month history of lower abdominal pain for which she has been to the emergency room twice.  She describes the pain as bilateral, intermittent, and non-radiating.  It decreases slightly when she eats and increases with activity.  She states the pain when it comes can last for half-a-day.  It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.,Approximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.  This showed a 1.9 x 1.4-cm cyst on the right with no free fluid.  The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.  Two days later, the pain resolved and she has not had a recurrence.  She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.,In addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.,She has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.  She is very interested in not having pain with her periods and if this was a cyst that caused her pain, she is interested in starting birth control pills to prevent this from happening again.,PAST MEDICAL HX:  ,Pneumonia in 2002, depression diagnosed in 2005, and seizures as an infant.,PAST SURGICAL HX:  ,Plastic surgery on her ear after a dog bite in 1997.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Zoloft 50 mg a day and LactAid.,ALLERGIES:  ,NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HX: , She enjoys cooking and scrapbooking.  She does have a boyfriend; again she states she is not sexually active.  She also states that she exercises regularly, does not smoke cigarettes, use drugs, or drink alcohol.,FAMILY HX: , Significant for her maternal grandfather with adult-onset diabetes, a maternal grandmother with hypertension, mother with depression, and a father who died of colon cancer at 32 years of age.  She also has a paternal great grandfather who was diagnosed with colon cancer.,PE: , VITALS: Height: 5 feet 5 inches.  Weight: 190 lb.  Blood Pressure: 120/88.  GENERAL: She is well-developed, well-nourished with normal habitus and no deformities.  NECK: Without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Deferred.,A/P: , Abdominal pain, unclear etiology.  I expressed my doubt that her pain was secondary to this 1.9-cm ovarian cyst given the fact that there was no free fluid surrounding this.  However, given that she has irregular periods and they are painful for her, I think it is reasonable to start her on a low-dose birth control pill.  She has no personal or familial contraindications to start this.  She was given a prescription for Lo/Ovral, dispensed 30 with refill x 4.  She will come back in six weeks for blood pressure check as well as in six months to followup on her pain and her bleeding patterns.,If she should have the recurrence of her pain, I have advised her to call.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Following premedication with Vistaril 50 mg and Atropine 0.4 mg IM, the patient received Versed 5.0 mg intravenously after Cetacaine spray to the posterior palate.  The Olympus video gastroscope was then introduced into the upper esophagus and passed by direct vision to the descending duodenum.  The upper, mid and lower portions of the esophagus; the lesser and greater curves of the stomach; anterior and posterior walls; body and antrum; pylorus; duodenal bulb; and duodenum were all normal.  No evidence of friability, ulceration or tumor mass was encountered.  The instrument was withdrawn to the antrum, and biopsies taken for CLO testing, and then the instrument removed.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:,  End-stage renal disease (ESRD).,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: , End-stage renal disease (ESRD).,PROCEDURE:,  Cadaveric renal transplant.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 46-year-old gentleman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes and hypertension, who had been on hemodialysis since 1993 and is also status post cadaveric kidney transplant in 1996 with chronic rejection.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

End-stage renal disease.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Coronary artery bypass graft x5 in 1995 and cadaveric renal transplant in 1996.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient denies tobacco or ethanol use.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Hypertension.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress, healthy-appearing male.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.6, blood pressure 166/106, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 18, and saturations 96% on room air.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.,PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.,PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA: , White blood cell count 6.4, hematocrit 34.6, and platelet count 182.  Sodium 137, potassium 5.4, BUN 41, creatinine 7.9, and glucose 295.  Total protein 6.5, albumin 3.4, AST 51, ALT 51, alk phos 175, and total bilirubin 0.5.,COURSE IN HOSPITAL: , The patient was admitted postoperatively to the surgical intensive care unit.  Initially, the patient had a decrease in hematocrit from 30 to 25.  The patient's hematocrit stabilized at 25.  During the patient's stay, the patient's creatinine progressively decreased from 8.1 to a creatinine at the time of discharge of 2.3.  The patient was making excellent urine throughout his stay.  The patient's Jackson-Pratt drain was removed on postoperative day #1 and he was moved to the floor.  The patient was advanced in diet appropriately.  The patient was started on Prograf by postoperative day #2.  Initial Prograf levels came back high at 18.  The patient's Prograf doses were changed accordingly and today, the patient is deemed stable to be discharged home.  During the patient's stay, the patient received four total doses of Thymoglobulin.  Today, he will complete his final dose of Thymoglobulin prior to being discharged.  In addition, today, the patient has an elevated blood pressure of 198/96.  The patient is being given an extra dose of metoprolol for this blood pressure.  In addition, the patient has an elevated glucose of 393 and for this reason he has been given an extra dose of insulin.  These labs will be rechecked later today and once his blood pressure has decreased to systolic blood pressure less than 116 and his glucose has come down to a more normal level, he will be discharged to home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , The patient is discharged with instructions to seek medical attention in the event if he develops fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, decreased urine output, or other concerns.  He is discharged on a low-potassium diet with activity as tolerated.  He is instructed that he may shower; however, he is to undergo no underwater soaking activities for approximately two weeks.  The patient will be followed up in the Transplant Clinic at ABCD tomorrow, at which time, his labs will be rechecked.  The patient's Prograf levels at the time of discharge are pending; however, given that his Prograf dose was decreased, he will be followed tomorrow at the Renal Transplant Clinic.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right tympanic membrane perforation.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right tympanic membrane perforation along with chronic otitis media.,PROCEDURE: , Right ear examination under anesthesia.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 15-year-old child with history of a right tympanic membrane perforation following tube placement as well as right conductive hearing loss.  Exam in the office revealed a posterior superior right marginal tympanic perforation.  Risks and benefits of surgery including risk of bleeding, general anesthesia, hearing loss as well as recurrent perforation were discussed with the mother.  The mother wished to proceed with surgery.,FINDINGS:,  The patient was brought to the room, placed in supine position, given general endotracheal anesthesia.  The postauricular crease was then injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine along with external meatus.  An area of the scalp was shaved above the ear and then also 1% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine injected, a total of 4 mL local anesthetic was used.  The ear was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The microscope was then brought into view and examining the marginal perforation, the patient was noted to have large granuloma under the tympanic membrane at the anterior border of the drum.  The granulation tissue was debrided as much as possible.  Decision was made to cancel the tympanoplasty after debriding the middle ear space as much as possible.  The middle ear space was filled with Floxin drops.  The patient woke up anesthesia, extubated, and brought to recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  Needle and sponge was correct.  Estimated blood loss minimal.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient presents today for followup, recently noted for E. coli urinary tract infection.  She was treated with Macrobid for 7 days, and only took one nighttime prophylaxis.  She discontinued this medication to due to skin rash as well as hives.  Since then, this had resolved.  Does not have any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills.  Daytime frequency every two to three hours, nocturia times one, no incontinence, improving stress urinary incontinence after Prometheus pelvic rehabilitation.,Renal ultrasound, August 5, 2008, reviewed, no evidence of hydronephrosis, bladder mass or stone.  Discussed.,Previous urine cultures have shown E. coli, November 2007, May 7, 2008 and July 7, 2008.,CATHETERIZED URINE: , Discussed, agreeable done using standard procedure.  A total of 30 mL obtained.,IMPRESSION: , Recurrent urinary tract infection in a patient recently noted for another Escherichia coli urinary tract infection, completed the therapeutic dose, but stopped the prophylactic Macrodantin due to hives.  This has resolved.,PLAN: , We will send the urine for culture and sensitivity, if no infection, patient will call results on Monday, and she will be placed on Keflex nighttime prophylaxis, otherwise followup as previously scheduled for a diagnostic cystoscopy with Dr. X.  All questions answered.
REASON FOR REFERRAL:  ,The patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.,BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:,RELEVANT HISTORY:,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with ,the patient.,The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  The patient reports an extensive neurological history.  Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved "honors in school" and "looked smart."  She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  She reported that she will frequently "bang her head against the wall" to relieve the pain.  The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and "thrown two and a half city blocks."  The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  Her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008.  When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal.  She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG.  She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and "tunnel vision" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was "spazzing out" on the floor.  During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel.  She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  She said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  At the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.  The patient is living with her biological mother.  Although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful.  She reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them.,At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient's medication included Ativan, Imitrex, Levoxyl, vitamin B12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and Zofran as needed.  (It should be noted that The patient by the time of the feedback on September 19, 2008 had resumed taking her Trileptal for bipolar disorder.).  The patient's familial medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.,TESTS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Cognistat,Mattis Dementia Rating Scale,Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - III (WAIS-III),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Selected Subtests from the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS),  Trail Making Test,  Verbal Fluency (Letter Fluency & Category Fluency),  Design Fluency,  Color-Word Interference Test,  Tower,Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST),Stroop Test,Color Trails,Trails A & B,Test of Variables of Attention,Multilingual Aphasia Examination II,  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test-2 (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test,The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI),The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Motor Coordination,The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Perception,Judgment Line Orientation,Grooved Pegboard,Purdue Pegboard,Finger Tapping Test,Rey Complex Figure,Wechsler Memory Scale -III (WMS-III),California Verbal Learning Test

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral fifth toes.,3.  Distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral third and fourth toes.,4.  Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Penoscrotal hypospadias with chordee.,PROCEDURE:,  Hypospadias repair (TIT and tissue flap relocation) and Nesbit tuck chordee release.,ANESTHESIA: , General inhalation anesthetic with a caudal block.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: , 300 mL of crystalloids.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 15 mL.,SPECIMENS: , No tissue sent to Pathology.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , An 8-French Zaontz catheter.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 1-1/2-year-old boy with penoscrotal hypospadias; plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  IV antibiotic was given.  The dorsal hood was retracted and the patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans for traction.  His urethra was calibrated, it was quite thin, to a 10-French with the straight sounds.  We then marked the coronal cuff and the urethral plate as well as the penile shaft skin with marking pen and incised the coronal cuff circumferentially and then around the urethral plate with the 15 blade knife and then degloved the penis with a curved tenotomy scissors.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The ventral chordee tissue was removed.  We then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline did an artificial erection test, which showed that he had a persistent chordee.  In the midline a 15 blade knife was used to incise Buck fascia after marking the area of chordee with the marking pen.  We then used a Heinecke-Mikulicz Nesbit tuck with 5-0 Prolene to straighten the penis.  Artificial erection again performed showed the penis was straight.  The knot was buried with figure-of-eight suture of 7-0 Vicryl in Buck fascia above it.  We then left the tourniquet in place and then after marking the urethral plate incised it and enlarged it with Beaver blade and a 15 blade.  We then elevated the glanular wings as well in the similar fashion.  An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed and the urethral plate was then closed over this with a distal interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl and then a running subcuticular closure of 7-0 Vicryl to close the defect.  We then put the stay sutures in the inter-preputial skin with 7-0 Vicryl and then rotated a flap using the subcutaneous tissue after dissecting it down to the pubis at the base of the penile shaft on the dorsum using the curved iris scissors.  We buttonholed the flap and then placed it through the penis as a sleeve.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl then used to reapproximate and to tack this flap and place over the urethroplasty.  Once this was done, a two 5-0 Vicryl deep sutures were placed in the glans to rotate the glans and allow for hemostasis.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were then used to create the neomeatus and horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl used to reconstitute the glans.  We then removed the excessive preputial skin and using tacking sutures of 6-0 chromic tacked the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum we dropped a portion of the skin down on the left side of the penis to reconstitute the penoscrotal junction using horizontal mattress sutures.  We then closed the ventral defect.  Once this was done, the stay suture in the glans was used to keep the Zaontz catheter to tack it into place.  We then used Surgicel, Dermabond, and Telfa dressing with Mastisol and an eye tape to keep the dressing in place.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  The patient was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.
IDENTIFYING DATA:,  The patient is a 45-year-old white male.  He is unemployed, presumably on disability and lives with his partner.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , "I'm in jail because I was wrongly arrested." The patient is admitted on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.,On the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.,I was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient's longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient's dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient's partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was "useful, but not dosed high enough." Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.

REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Cardiac evaluation and treatment in a patient who came in the hospital with abdominal pain.,HISTORY:,  This is a 77-year-old white female patient whom I have known for the last about a year or so who has underlying multiple medical problems including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight years ago at Halifax Medical Center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary arteries.  Since then, she has generally done well.  She used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in September 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy.,The patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well.  Recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort.  Yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m.  The discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding.  Later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting.  She denied any diarrhea.  No history of fever or chills.  Since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same.  She was given morphine, Zofran, Demerol, another Zofran, and Reglan as well as Demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids.  Subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning.  The patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment.  At the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind.  She has not been fed any food, however.  The patient also had had pelvis and abdominal CT scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area.  The patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been described.  A 1.5-mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney.  The patient also has been described to have diverticulosis without diverticulitis on this finding.,Currently however, the patient has no clinical symptoms according to her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  She has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 15 years, diabetes mellitus for the last eight years, and coronary artery disease for last about eight years or so.

She has a small myocardial infarction and then she was under the care of Dr. A and she had aortocoronary bypass surgery at Halifax Medical Center by Dr. B, which was a three-vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and distal right coronary artery respectively.,She had had nuclear stress test with Dr. C on September 3, 2008, which was described to be abnormal with ischemic defects, but I do not think the patient had any further cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography after that.  She has been treated medically.,This patient also had an admission to this hospital in May 2008 also for partial small bowel obstruction and cholelithiasis and sigmoid diverticulosis.  She was described to have had a hemorrhagic cyst of the right kidney.  She has mild arthritis for the last 10 or 15 years.  She has a history of GERD for the last 20 years, and she also has a history of peptic ulcer disease in the duodenum, but never had any bleeding.  She has a history of diverticulosis as mentioned.  No history of TIA or CVA.  She has one kidney.  She was in a car accident in 1978 and afterwards she had to have left nephrectomy as well as splenectomy because of rupture.  The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism once about eight years ago after her aortocoronary bypass surgery.  She describes this to be a clot on left lung.  I am not sure if she had any long-term treatment, however.,In the past, the patient had aortocoronary bypass surgery in 2003 and incisional hernia surgery in 1979 as well as hysterectomy in 1979 and she had splenectomy and nephrectomy as described in 1978.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Her father died at age of 65 of massive heart attack and mother died at age of 62 of cancer.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Acute on chronic renal failure.,2.  Uremia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Acute on chronic renal failure.,2.  Uremia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Insertion of a right internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter.,ANESTHESIA: , 1% local lidocaine.,BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 5 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 74-year-old Caucasian male who presents via direct admission for acute on chronic renal failure with uremia.  The patient incidentally was in a car accident ten days ago and has been feeling pretty awful since that time.  He is slightly short of breath with mild difficulty in breathing.  A pre-procedure x-ray was obtained, which showed no pneumothorax.  He did have a significant right pleural effusion and a mild left pleural effusion.  We decided to insert the catheter on the right side.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine was used to anesthetize the area two fingerbreadths above the clavicle just posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and below the external jugular vein.  Using the same anesthetic needle, the right internal jugular vein was used to cannulate with good venous blood return.  The tract was noted.,The needle was removed and a second #18 gauge thin-walled needle was used along same tract to cannulate the right internal jugular vein also without difficulty and good venous blood return.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein also without difficulty.  The needle was removed and an #11 blade was used to make a small skin incision provided skin and vein dilators were used.  The circle-C 8-inch hemodialysis catheter was then inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  Both of the ports were aspirated venous blood without difficulty and both flushed also without difficulty.  The ports were flushed with injectable normal saline secondary to the patient going for dialysis today.  Thus, he will not need heparinization of the lines.  Again, he tolerated the procedure well.  A postoperative x-ray would be obtained to check catheter placement and rule out pneumothorax.
TITLE OF OPERATION:,1.  Austin-Akin bunionectomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.,2.  Weil osteotomy with internal screw fixation, first right metatarsal.,3.  Arthroplasty, second right PIP joint.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bunion deformity, right foot.,2.  Dislocated second right metatarsophalangeal joint.,3.  Hammertoe deformity, second right digit.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bunion deformity, right foot.,2.  Dislocated second right metatarsophalangeal joint.,3.  Hammertoe deformity, second right digit.,ANESTHESIA:,  Monitored anesthesia care with 20 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain.,HEMOSTASIS:,  60 minutes, a right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 mL.,PREOPERATIVE INJECTABLES:  ,1 g Ancef IV 30 minutes preoperatively.,MATERIALS USED: , 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Prolene, as well as two 16-mm partially treaded cannulated screws of the OsteoMed system, one 18-mm partially treaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system of the 3.0 size.  One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg.  The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique.  One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed.  The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  The area was flushed copiously with saline.  Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision.  Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint.  The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint.  A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Chronic sinusitis with deviated nasal septum and nasal obstruction and hypertrophied turbinates.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED: , Septoplasty with partial inferior middle turbinectomy with KTP laser, sinus endoscopy with maxillary antrostomies, removal of tissue, with septoplasty and partial ethmoidectomy bilaterally.,OPERATION: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  After adequate anesthesia via endotracheal intubation, the nose was prepped with Afrin nasal spray.  After this was done, 1% Xylocaine with 100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in both sides of the septum and the mucoperichondrium.  After this, the sinus endoscope at 25-degrees was then used to examine the nasal cavity in the left nasal cavity and staying lateral to the middle turbinate.  A 45-degree forceps then used to open up the maxillary sinus.  There was some prominent tissue and just superior to this, the anterior ethmoid was opened.  The 45-degree forceps was then used to open the maxillary sinus ostium.  This was enlarged with backbiting rongeur.  After this was done, the tissue found in the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were removed and sent to pathology and labeled as left maxillary sinus mucosa.  After this was done, attention was then turned to the right nasal cavity staying laterally to the middle turbinate.  There was noted to have prominence in the anterior ethmoidal area.  This was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  This mucosa was then removed from the anterior area.  The maxillary sinus ostium was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  Tissue was removed from this area.  This was sent as right maxillary mucosa.  After this, the backbiting rongeur was then used to open up the ostium and enlarge the ostium on the right maxillary sinus.  Protecting the eyes with wet gauze and using KTP laser at 10 watts, the sinus endoscope was used for observation and the submucosal resection was done of both inferior turbinates as well as anterior portion of the middle turbinates bilaterally.  This was to open up to expose the maxillary ostium as well as other sinus ostium to minimize swelling and obstruction.  After this was completed, a septoplasty was performed.  The incision was made with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The flap was then elevated, overlying the spur that was protruding into the right nasal cavity.  This was excised with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The tissue was then laid back in position.  After this was laid back in position, the nasal cavity was irrigated with saline solution, suctioned well as well as the oropharynx.  , ,Surgicel with antibiotic ointment was placed in each nostril and sutured outside the nose with 3-0 nylon.  The patient was then awakened and taken to recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Refractory dyspepsia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Hiatal hernia.,2.  Reflux esophagitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with pseudo and esophageal biopsy.,ANESTHESIA:,  Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed.,SPECIMEN: , Esophageal biopsy.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,HISTORY:,  The patient is a 52-year-old female morbidly obese black female who has a long history of reflux and GERD type symptoms including complications such as hoarseness and chronic cough.  She has been on multiple medical regimens and continues with dyspeptic symptoms.,PROCEDURE: , After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated.  At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present.  There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis.  The scope was then passed into the stomach.  It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum.  The pylorus was patent.  There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum.,A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized.  The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body.  Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will return to the General Medical Floor.  We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions.  She should also attempt significant weight loss.
Pitocin was started quickly to allow for delivery as quickly as possible and the patient rapidly became complete, and then as she began to push, there were additional decelerations of the baby's heart rate, which were suspicions of cord around the neck.  These were variable decelerations occurring late in the contraction phase.  The baby was in a +2 at a 3 station in an occiput anterior position, and so a low-forceps delivery was performed with Tucker forceps using gentle traction, and the baby was delivered with a single maternal pushing effort with retraction by the forceps.  The baby was a little bit depressed at birth because of the cord around the neck, and the cord had to be cut before the baby was delivered because of the tension, but she responded quickly to stimulus and was given an Apgar of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  The female infant seemed to weigh about 7.5 pounds, but has not been officially weighed yet.  Cord gases were sent and the placenta was sent to Pathology.  The cervix, the placenta, and the rectum all seemed to be intact.  The second-degree episiotomy was repaired with 2-O and 3-0 Vicryl.  Blood loss was about 400 mL.,Because of the hole in the dura, plan is to keep the patient horizontal through the day and a Foley catheter is left in place.  She is continuing to be attended to by the anesthesiologist who will manage the epidural catheter.  The baby's father was present for the delivery, as was one of the patient's sisters.  All are relieved and pleased with the good outcome.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Open left angle comminuted angle of mandible, 802.35, and open symphysis of mandible, 802.36.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Open left angle comminuted angle of mandible, 802.35, and open symphysis of mandible, 802.36.,PROCEDURE:,  Open reduction, internal fixation (ORIF) of bilateral mandible fractures with multiple approaches, CPT code 21470, and surgical extraction of teeth #17, CPT code 41899.,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia via nasal endotracheal intubation.,FLUIDS: , 1800 mL of LR.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 150 mL.,HARDWARE:  ,A 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate from Leibinger on the symphysis and a 2.0 reconstruction plate on the left angle.,SPECIMEN: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,CONDITION: , The patient was extubated to the PACU, breathing spontaneously in excellent good condition.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 55-year-old male that he is 12 hour status post interpersonal violence in which he sustained bilateral mandible fractures and positive loss of consciousness.  He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  The patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the PACU in excellent condition.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy.,OPERATION PERFORMED:  Adenotonsillectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS:  The patient is a very nice patient with adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy and obstructive symptoms.  Adenotonsillectomy is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, table was turned and shoulder roll was placed on the shoulders and face was draped in clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted anteriorly and the McIvor was gently suspended from a Mayo stand.  A red rubber Robinson catheter was inserted through the left naris and the soft palate was retracted superiorly.  The adenoids were removed with suction electrocautery under mere visualization.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in the similar fashion and retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, L4-L5 and L5-S1 degenerative disk disease/disk protrusions/spondylosis with radiculopathy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, L4-L5 and L5-S1 degenerative disk disease/disk protrusions/spondylosis with radiculopathy.,PROCEDURE:,1. Left L4-L5 and L5-S1 Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF).,2. L4 to S1 fixation (Danek M8 system).,3. Right posterolateral L4 to S1 fusion.,4. Placement of intervertebral prosthetic device (Danek Capstone spacers L4-L5 and L5-S1).,5. Vertebral autograft plus bone morphogenetic protein (BMP).,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,SPECIMENS:, Portions of excised L4-L5 and L5-S1 disks.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 300 mL.,FLUIDS GIVEN:, IV crystalloid.,OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:, The patient is a 37-year-old male presenting with a history of chronic, persistent low back pain as well as left lower extremity of radicular character were recalcitrant to conservative management. Preoperative imaging studies revealed the above-noted abnormalities. After a detailed review of management considerations with the patient and his wife, he was elected to proceed as noted above.,Operative indications, methods, potential benefits, risks and alternatives were reviewed. The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was "under tapped" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures. The suprafascial subcutaneous layers were closed using multiple simple interrupted #0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed using staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and secured in place. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Blood loss anemia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Normal colon with no evidence of bleeding.,2.  Hiatal hernia.,3.  Fundal gastritis with polyps.,4.  Antral mass.,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed.,SPECIMEN:  ,Antrum and fundal polyps.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 66-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD Hospital with mental status changes.  She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss.  She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months.  After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids.  The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated.  The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum.  There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Air was aspirated.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed.  There was no evidence of perianal disease.  No source of the anemia was identified.,Attention was then taken for performing an EGD.  The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx.  The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed.  There were no abnormalities of the esophagus.  The stomach was entered and was insufflated.  The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum.  Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______.  It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm.  Several biopsies were taken.  The mass was soft.  The pylorus was then entered.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed.  In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation.  There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps.  Biopsy was also taken for CLO.  A hiatal hernia was present as well.  Air was aspirated.  The scope was slowly withdrawn.  The GE junction was unremarkable.  The scope was fully withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes.  We will await the biopsy reports and further recommendations will follow.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Tremor, dystonic form.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Tremor, dystonic form.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL.,ANESTHESIA:,  MAC (monitored anesthesia care) with local anesthesia.,TITLE OF PROCEDURES:,1.  Left frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode.,2.  Right frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode.,3.  Microelectrode recording of deep brain structures.,4.  Stereotactic volumetric CT scan of head for target coordinate determination.,5.  Intraoperative programming and assessment of device.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of dystonic tremor.  The movements have been refractory to aggressive medical measures, felt to be candidate for deep brain stimulation.  The procedure is discussed below.,I have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives.  She fully accepted and consented to the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition.  She was placed on the operating table in seated position.  Her head was shaved.  Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes.  IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation.  She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken.  The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen.  Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint.  Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates.,The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again.  Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit.  At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes.  Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field.  This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.,A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings.  Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture.  Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field.  Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill.  The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade.  The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well.  The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame.  Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc.  Microelectrode recording was then performed.  The signatures of the cells were recognized.  Microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted.  The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed.  Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side.  This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.,Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system.  The microelectrode unit was then remounted.  Microelectrode recording was then undertaken.  After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed.  Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory.  The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box.  Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side.  This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system.  The arc was then removed.  A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.,We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally.  Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used.  Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only.  Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The Leksell arc was then removed.,She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.  All needle, sponge, cottonoid, and blade counts were correct x2 as verified by the nurses.

This involved cough, post-tussive emesis, questionable fever, but only 99.7.  Their usual doctor prescribed amoxicillin over the phone.  The coughing persisted and worsened.  She went to the ER, where sats were normal at baseline, but dropped into the 80s with coughing spells.  They did witness some apnea.  They gave some Rocephin, did some labs, and the patient was transferred to hospital.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On admission, GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished baby in no apparent distress. HEENT:  There was some nasal discharge.  Remainder of the HEENT was normal.  LUNG:  Had few rhonchi.  No retractions.  No significant coughing or apnea during the admission physical.  ABDOMEN:  Benign.  EXTREMITIES:  Were without any cyanosis.,SIGNIFICANT LABS AND X-RAYS:  ,She had a CBC done Garberville, which showed a white count of 12.4, with a differential of 10 segs, 82 lymphs, 8 monos, hemoglobin of 15, hematocrit 42, platelets 296,000, and a normal BMP.  An x-ray was done and I do not have an official interpretation, but to the admitting physician, Dr. X it showed no significant infiltrate.  Well at hospital, she had a rapid influenza swab done, which was negative.  She had a rapid RSV done, which is still not in the chart, but I believe I was told that it was negative.  She also had a pertussis PCR swab done and a pertussis culture done, neither of which has result in the chart.  I do know that the pertussis culture proved to be negative.,CONSULTATION: , Public Health Department was notified of a case of suspected pertussis.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The baby was afebrile.  Required no oxygen in the hospital.  Actually fed reasonably well.  Did have one episode of coughing with slight emesis.  Appeared basically quite well between episodes.  Had no apnea witnessed and after overnight observation, the parents were anxious to go home.  The patient was started on Zithromax in the hospital.,CONDITION AND TREATMENT: , The patient was in stable condition and good condition on exam at the time and was discharged home on Zithromax to be followed up in the office within a week.,INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENT:,  Include usual diet and to follow up within a week, but certainly sooner if the coughing is worse and there is cyanosis or apnea again.
PROCEDURE:, Delayed primary chest closure.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a newborn with diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome who 48 hours prior to the current procedure has undergone a modified stage 1 Norwood operation.  Given the magnitude of the operation and the size of the patient (2.5 kg), we have elected to leave the chest open to facilitate postoperative management.  He is now taken back to the operative room for delayed primary chest closure.,PREOP DX: , Open chest status post modified stage 1 Norwood operation.,POSTOP DX:,  Open chest status post modified stage 1 Norwood operation.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS:,  No evidence of intramediastinal purulence or hematoma.  He tolerated the procedure well.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  Following general endotracheal anesthesia, the chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previously placed AlloDerm membrane was removed.  Mediastinal cultures were obtained, and the mediastinum was then profusely irrigated and suctioned.  Both cavities were also irrigated and suctioned.  The drains were flushed and repositioned.  Approximately 30 cubic centimeters of blood were drawn slowly from the right atrial line.  The sternum was then smeared with a vancomycin paste.  The proximal aspect of the 5 mm RV-PA conduit was marked with a small titanium clip at its inferior most aspect and with an additional one on its rightward inferior side.  The sternum was then closed with stainless steel wires followed by closure of subcutaneous tissues with interrupted monofilament stitches.  The skin was closed with interrupted nylon sutures and a sterile dressing was placed.  The peritoneal dialysis catheter, atrial and ventricular pacing wires were removed.  The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive unit shortly thereafter in very stable condition.,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.
PROCEDURE:,  Diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,  Plain lidocaine 2% was given intrabronchially for local anesthesia.,PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:,  ,1.  Lortab (10 mg) plus Phenergan (25 mg), p.o.  1 hour before the procedure.,2.  Versed a total of 5 mg given IV push during the procedure.,INDICATIONS: ,
A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve.  This was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation was good.  The ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of terminal ileum was inspected and was normal.  The colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.
TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Endoscopic and microsurgical transnasal resection of cystic suprasellar tumor.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , She is a 3-year-old girl who is known to have a head injury and CT in 2005 was normal, presented with headache.  All endocrine labs were normal.  Surgery was recommended.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Cystic suprasellar tumor.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Cystic suprasellar tumor.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , The patient was brought to operating room, underwent smooth induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, head was placed in the horseshoe head rest and positioned supine with head turned slightly towards left and slightly extended.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  With the assistance of fluoro and mapping the localization, the right nostril was infiltrated.  Dr. X will dictate the procedure of the approach.  Once the dura was visualized, there was a complex procedure secondary to the small nasal naris as well as the bony drilling that would necessitate significant drilling.  Once the operating microscope was in the field, at this point, the drilling was completed.  The dura was opened in cruciate fashion revealing normal pituitary, which was displaced and the cystic tumor.  This was then opened and using microsurgical technique with the curette suctioned and the pituitary calcifications were removed, several Valsalva maneuvers were performed without any evidence of CSF leak and trying to pull the tumor further down.  Once this was completed, there was no evidence of any bleeding.  The endoscope was then used to remove any residual fragments __________ with the arachnoid.  Once this was completely ensured, small piece of Duragel was placed and the closure will be dictated by Dr. X.  She was reversed, extubated, and transported to the ICU in stable condition.  Blood loss, minimal.  All sponge, needle counts were correct.
PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Catheterization Laboratory.  After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl.  The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine.  Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.  We did a right femoral angiogram; however, the Angio-Seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a Femostop.  We transported the patient to his room in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA:,  Left main coronary is normal.  Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.  The diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  There is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.  When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  We re-dilated and then deployed.  Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA.  The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  We got a wire through and dilated this.  We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there.,IMPRESSION: , Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  Minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.

The patient is stable and will be discharged.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: , This patient presents with the above history.  Laboratory evaluation today indicates the following problems, anemia and hyponatremia.  This could contribute the patient's feelings of tiredness and not feeling well.  There is no evidence of rectal bleeding at this time.  The patient was advised that she needs to follow up with Dr. X to further investigate these problems.  The patient is hemodynamically stable and will be discharged.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Acute tiredness.,2.  Anemia of unknown etiology.,3.

Recommend follow up with personal physician, Dr. X in two to three days for recheck.  Return to ED sooner if condition changes or worsen anyway.  Discharged in stable condition.
HYPERFRACTIONATION,This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of known malignancy.  The radiotherapy will be given in a hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours).  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly oxygenated tumors.  The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic principles.,During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.  Felodipine 10 mg once a day.,5.  Klor-Con 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.,6.  Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily presumably for GERD.,7.  MiraLax 17 g p.o. daily.,8.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN.  IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.
PROCEDURE: , Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block.,INDICATION: , Sacroiliac joint pain.,INFORMED CONSENT: , The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE:  ,Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.  Approximately 0.25 mL of nonionic contrast agent was injected showing no concurrent vascular dye pattern.  Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of 0.5% of bupivacaine was injected to each area.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,ADDITIONAL DETAILS: , This was then repeated on the left side.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISCUSSION:  ,Postprocedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to resume normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made at the PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately 1 week.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis secondary to bilateral tinea pedis.,2.  Prostatic hypertrophy with bladder outlet obstruction.,3.  Cerebral palsy.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , The patient would be discharged on his usual Valium 10-20 mg at bedtime for spasticity, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, cefazolin 500 mg q.i.d., and Lotrimin cream between toes b.i.d. for an additional two weeks.  He will be followed in the office.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a pleasant 62-year-old male with cerebral palsy.  The patient was recently admitted to Hospital with lower extremity cellulitis.  This resolved, however, recurred in both legs.  Examination at the time of this admission demonstrated peeling of the skin and excoriation between all of his toes on both feet consistent with tinea pedis.,PAST MEDICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:,  As per the admission record.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , As per the admission record.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,As per the admission record.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , At the time of admission, his white blood cell count was 8200 with a normal differential, hemoglobin 13.6, hematocrit 40.6 with normal indices, and platelet count was 250,000.  Comprehensive metabolic profile was unremarkable, except for a nonfasting blood sugar of 137, lactic acid was 0.8.  Urine demonstrated 4-9 red blood cells per high-powered field with 2+ bacteria.  Blood culture and wound cultures were unremarkable.  Chest x-ray was unremarkable.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the General Medical floor and treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and topical Lotrimin.  On this regimen, his lower extremity edema and erythema resolved quite rapidly.,Because of urinary frequency, a bladder scan was done suggesting about 600 cc of residual urine.  A Foley catheter was inserted and was productive of approximately 500 cc of urine.  The patient was prescribed Flomax 0.4 mg daily.  24 hours later, the Foley catheter was removed and a bladder scan demonstrated 60 cc of residual urine after approximately eight hours.,At the time of this dictation, the patient was ambulating minimally, however, not sufficiently to resume independent living.

INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY SIMULATION,The patient will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy in order to deliver high-dose treatment to sensitive structures.  The target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.,Initially, the preliminary isocenter is set on a fluoroscopically-based simulation unit.  The patient is appropriately immobilized using a customized immobilization device.  Preliminary simulation films are obtained and approved by me.  The patient is marked and transferred to the CT scanner.  Sequential images are obtained and transferred electronically to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis then occurs.  The target volume, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition organs at risk are outlined.  Appropriate doses are selected, both for the target, as well as constraints for organs at risk.  Inverse treatment planning is performed by the physics staff under my supervision.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician and completion of successful quality assurance.
DIAGNOSIS:,  Refractory anemia that is transfusion dependent.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , I needed a blood transfusion.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with no substantial past medical history except for diabetes.  He denies any comorbid complications of the diabetes including kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, vision loss, or neuropathy.  At this time, he has been admitted for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 and requiring transfusion.  He reports that he has no signs or symptom of bleeding and had a blood transfusion approximately two months ago and actually several weeks before that blood transfusion, he had a transfusion for anemia.  He has been placed on B12, oral iron, and Procrit.  At this time, we are asked to evaluate him for further causes and treatment for his anemia.  He denies any constitutional complaints except for fatigue, malaise, and some dyspnea.  He has no adenopathy that he reports.  No fevers, night sweats, bone pain, rash, arthralgias, or myalgias.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Diabetes.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Hernia repair.,ALLERGIES: , He has no allergies.,MEDICATIONS: , Listed in the chart and include Coumadin, Lasix, metformin, folic acid, diltiazem, B12, Prevacid, and Feosol.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is a tobacco user.  He does not drink.  He lives alone, but has family and social support to look on him.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Negative for blood or cancer disorders according to the patient.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  He is an elderly gentleman in no acute distress.  He is sitting up in bed eating his breakfast.  He is alert and oriented and answering questions appropriately.,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure of 110/60, pulse of 99, respiratory rate of 14, and temperature of 97.4.  He is 69 inches tall and weighs 174 pounds.,HEENT:  Sclerae show mild arcus senilis in the right.  Left is clear.  Pupils are equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.,NECK:  Supple.  Trachea is midline.  No jugular venous pressure distention is noted.  No adenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary areas.,CHEST:  Clear.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  There may be some fullness in the left upper quadrant, although I do not appreciate a true spleen with inspiration.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, but there is some edema, but no cyanosis.,NEUROLOGIC:  Noncontributory.,DERMATOLOGIC:  Noncontributory.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Noncontributory.,IMPRESSION: , At this time is refractory anemia, which is transfusion dependent.  He is on B12, iron, folic acid, and Procrit.  There are no sign or symptom of blood loss and a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was negative.  His creatinine was 1.  My impression at this time is that he probably has an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or bone marrow failure.  His creatinine on this hospitalization was up slightly to 1.6 and this may contribute to his anemia.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,At this time, my recommendation for the patient is that he undergoes further serologic evaluation with reticulocyte count, serum protein, and electrophoresis, LDH, B12, folate, erythropoietin level, and he should undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  I have discussed the procedure in detail which the patient.  I have discussed the risks, benefits, and successes of that treatment and usefulness of the bone marrow and predicting his cause of refractory anemia and further therapeutic interventions, which might be beneficial to him.  He is willing to proceed with the studies I have described to him.  We will order an ultrasound of his abdomen because of the possible fullness of the spleen, and I will probably see him in follow up after this hospitalization.,As always, we greatly appreciate being able to participate in the care of your patient.  We appreciate the consultation of the patient.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe low back pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe low back pain.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED: , Anterior lumbar fusion, L4-L5, L5-S1, PEEK vertebral spacer, structural autograft from L5 vertebral body, BMP and anterior plate.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 50 mL.,DRAINS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS:,  Dr. X made the approach and once we were at the L5-S1 disk space, we removed the disk and we placed a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer filled with a core of bone taken from the L5 vertebral body.  This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.  Following this, bleeding points were controlled and Dr. X proceeded with the closure of the abdomen.,SUMMARY: , This is a 51-year-old man who reports 15-year history of low back pain and intermittent bilateral leg pain and achiness.  He has tried multiple conservative treatments including physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, etc.  MRI scan shows a very degenerated disk at L5-S1, less so at L3-L4 and L4-L5.  A discogram was positive with the lower 3 levels, but he has pain, which starts below the iliac crest and I feel that the L3-L4 disk is probably that symptomatic.  An anterior lumbar interbody fusion was suggested.  Procedure, risks, and complications were explained.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.,2.  History of T9 vertebral fracture.,3.  Diskitis.,4.  Thrombocytopenia.,5.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately 30%.,6.  Diabetes, type 2.,7.  Protein malnourishment.,8.  History of anemia.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 77-year-old white male who presented to Hospital of Bossier on April 14, 2008.  The patient was found to have lumbar diskitis and was going to require extensive antibiotic therapy, which was the cause of need for continued hospitalization.  He also needed to continue with dialysis and he needed to improve his rehabilitation.  The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through rehab fairly well without any significant troubles.  He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management.  The patient had remained afebrile.  He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of a sundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise.  On the day of discharge, on May 9, 2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid.  He denied any complaints of pain.  He did have some trouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day.  The patient has increased his appetite some and has been eating some.  His vital signs remain stable.  His blood pressure on discharge was 126/63, heart rate is 80, respiratory rate of 20 and temperature was 98.3.  PPD was negative.  An SMS form was filled out in plan for his discharge and he was sent with medications that he had been receiving while here at Promise.,The patient and his family understood our plan and agreed with it.  He thanked us for the care that he received at Promise and thought that they did a fantastic job taking care of him.  He did not have any acute questions as to where he was going and what the next step of his care would be, but we did discuss this at length prior to date of discharge.,
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Acute subdural hematoma, right, with herniation syndrome.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Acute subdural hematoma, right, with herniation syndrome.,OPERATION PERFORMED:  ,Right frontotemporoparietal craniotomy, evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PREPARATION: , Povidone.,INDICATION:,  This is an 83-year-old male with herniation syndrome with large subdural hematoma 100%.  This procedure is being done as an emergency procedure in an attempt to save his life and maximize the potential for recovery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room intubated.  The patient previously was given fresh frozen plasma plus recombinant activated factor VII.  The patient had a roll placed on his right shoulder, head was maintained three point fixation with a Mayfield headholder.  The right side of the head was shaved, thoroughly prepped and draped, a large ? scalp incision was marked, infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel, Raney clips were applied to the scalp margins, hemostasis, temporalis muscle and fascia, pericranium opened and aligned with incision, flap was reflected anteriorly.  Burr holes are placed low in the temporal bone at the keyhole posteriorly and then superiorly with a perforator, then using Midas Rex drill with a B1 foot plate a free flap was turned.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion, acute subdural hematoma was evacuated.  There was a small arterial bleeder in the anterior parietal region, which was controlled with bipolar electrocautery.  Using suction and biopsy forceps, acute clot was resected from the frontotemporoparietal and occipital poles, subdural space was irrigated, no further bleeders were encountered.  Dura was closed with 4-0 Nurolon.  A subdural Camino ICP catheter was placed in the subdural space.  Bone flaps secured in place with neuro clips with 5 mm screws, central pack up suture was placed, dural tack up sutures were placed using 4-0 Nurolon prior to placement of the bone flap.  The wound was irrigated with saline, temporalis muscle and fascia closed with 2-0 Vicryl, subgaleal Hemovac was placed, galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, and scalp with staples.  ICP monitor and the Hemovac were sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl.  The patient was taken out of the head holder, a sterile dressing placed.  The head was wrapped.  The patient was taken directly to ICU, still intubated in guarded condition.  Brain was nicely soft and pulsatile.  At the termination of the procedure, no significant contusion of the brain was identified.  Final sponge and needle counts are correct.  Estimated blood loss 400 cc.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mesothelioma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Mesothelioma.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Placement of Port-A-Cath, left subclavian vein with fluoroscopy.,ASSISTANT:,  None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman who underwent right thoracoscopy and was found to have biopsy-proven mesothelioma.  He was brought to the operating room now for Port-A-Cath placement for chemotherapy.  After informed consent was obtained with the patient, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position.  After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, routine prep and drape of the left chest, left subclavian vein was cannulated with #18 gauze needle, and guidewire was inserted.  Needle was removed.  Small incision was made large enough to harbor the port.  Dilator and introducers were then placed over the guidewire.  Guidewire and dilator were removed, and a Port-A-Cath was introduced in the subclavian vein through the introducers.  Introducers were peeled away without difficulty.  He measured with fluoroscopy and cut to the appropriate length.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  It was then connected to the hub of the port.  Port was then aspirated for patency and flushed with heparinized saline and summoned to the chest wall.  Wounds were then closed.  Needle count, sponge count, and instrument counts were all correct.
CC:, Difficulty with word finding.,HX: ,This 27y/o RHF experienced sudden onset word finding difficulty and slurred speech on the evening of 2/19/96. She denied any associated dysphagia, diplopia, numbness or weakness of her extremities. She went to sleep with her symptoms on 2/19/96, and awoke with them on 2/20/96. She also awoke with a headache (HA) and mild neck stiffness. She took a shower and her HA and neck stiffness resolved. Throughout the day she continued to have difficulty with word finding and had worsening of her slurred speech. That evening, she began to experience numbness and weakness in the lower right face. She felt like there was a "rubber-band" wrapped around her tongue.,For 3 weeks prior to presentation, she experienced transient episodes of a "boomerang" shaped field cut in the left eye. The episodes were not associated with any other symptoms. One week prior to presentation, she went to a local ER for menorrhagia. She had just resumed taking oral birth control pills one week prior to the ER visit after having stopped their use for several months. Local evaluation included an unremarkable carotid duplex scan. However, a HCT with and without contrast reportedly revealed a left frontal gyriform enhancing lesion. An MRI brain scan on 2/20/96 revealed nonspecific white matter changes in the right periventricular region. EEG reportedly showed diffuse slowing. CRP was reportedly "too high" to calibrate.,MEDS:, Ortho-Novum 7-7-7 (started 2/3/96), and ASA (started 2/20/96).,PMH:, 1)ventral hernia repair 10 years ago, 2)mild "concussion" suffered during a MVA; without loss of consciousness, 5/93, 3) Anxiety disorder, 4) One childbirth.,FHX: ,She did not know her father and was not in contact with her mother.,SHX:, Lives with boyfriend.

Unemployed and formerly worked at an herbicide plant.,EXAM: ,BP150/79, HR77, RR22, 37.4C.,MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was dysarthric with mild decreased fluency marked by occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. She was able to repeat, though her repetition was occasionally marked by phonemic paraphasic errors. She had no difficulty with calculation.,CN: VFFTC, Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 3/3. EOM intact. No papilledema or hemorrhages seen on fundoscopy. No RAPD or INO. There was right lower facial weakness. Facial sensation was intact, bilaterally. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.,MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.,Sensory: No deficits.,Coord/Station/Gait: unremarkable.,Reflexes 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.,Gen Exam: unremarkable.,COURSE:, CRP 1.2 (elevated), ESR 10, RF 20, ANA 1:40, ANCA <1:40, TSH 2.0, FT4 1.73, Anticardiolipin antibody IgM 10.8GPL units (normal <10.9), Anticardiolipin antibody IgG 14.8GPL (normal<22.9), SSA and SSB were normal. Urine beta-hCG pregnancy and drug screen were negative. EKG, CXR and UA were negative.,MRI brain, 2/21/96 revealed increased signal on T2 imaging in the periventricular white matter region of the right hemisphere. In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia.,She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis.,2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change. Neuropsychologic testing the same day revealed slight impairment of complex attention only. She was started on Prednisone 60mg qd and Tagamet 400mg qhs.,On 2/26/96, she underwent a right frontal brain biopsy. Pathologic evaluation revealed evidence of focal necrosis (stroke/infarct), but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately following the brain biopsy, while still in the recovery room, she experienced sudden onset right hemiparesis and transcortical motor type aphasia. Initial HCT was unremarkable. An EEG was consistent with a focal lesion in the left hemisphere. However, a 2/28/96 MRI brain scan revealed new increased signal on T2 weighted images in a gyriform pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus. This was felt consistent with vasculitis.,She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96. She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan ( one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia.

Status post aortic valve replacement with St. Jude mechanical valve.,3. Pericardial tamponade.,PROCEDURE:,1. Emergent subxiphoid pericardial window.,2. Transesophageal echocardiogram.,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,FINDINGS:, The patient was noted to have 600 mL of dark bloody fluid around the pericardium. We could see the effusion resolve on echocardiogram. The aortic valve appeared to have good movement in the leaflets with no perivalvular leaks. There was no evidence of endocarditis. The mitral valve leaflets moved normally with some mild mitral insufficiency.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient was brought to the operating room emergently. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, his chest was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion. A small incision was made at the bottom of the previous sternotomy incision. The subcutaneous sutures were removed. The dissection was carried down into the pericardial space. Blood was evacuated without any difficulty. Pericardial Blake drain was then placed. The fascia was then reclosed with interrupted Vicryl sutures. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running Monocryl suture. A subdermal PDS followed by a subcuticular Monocryl suture were all performed. The wound was closed with Dermabond dressing. The procedure was terminated at this point. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned back to the intensive care unit in stable condition.
TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,1.  Arthrotomy, removal humeral head implant, right shoulder.,2.  Repair of torn subscapularis tendon (rotator cuff tendon) acute tear.,3.  Debridement glenohumeral joint.,4.  Biopsy and culturing the right shoulder.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient had done well after a previous total shoulder arthroplasty performed by Dr. X.  However, the patient was lifted with subsequent significant pain and apparent tearing of his subscapularis.  Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed with the patient at length including, but not exclusive of infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, incomplete return of function, continued instability, retearing of the tendon, need for revision of his arthroplasty, permanent nerve or artery damage, etc.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.  Torn subscapularis tendon, right shoulder.,2.  Right total shoulder arthroplasty (Biomet system).,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.  Torn subscapularis tendon, right shoulder.,2.  Right total shoulder arthroplasty (Biomet system).,3.  Diffuse synovitis, right shoulder.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was anesthetized in the supine position.  A Foley catheter was placed in his bladder.  He was then placed in a beach chair position.  He was brought to the side of the table and the torso secured with towels and tape.  His head was then placed in the neutral position with no lateral bending or extension.  It was secured with paper tape over his forehead.  Care was taken to stay off his auricular cartilages and his orbits.  Right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was given antibiotics well before the beginning of the procedure to decrease any risk of infection.  Once he had been prepped and draped with the standard prep, he was prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine-type skin prep.  This was allowed to dry and the skin was then covered with Ioban bandages also to decrease his risk of infection.,Also, preoperatively, the patient had his pacemaker defibrillator function turned off as a result during this case.  Bipolar type cautery had to be used as opposed to monopolar cautery.,The patient's deltopectoral incision was then opened and extended proximally and distally.  The patient had significant amount of scar already in this interval.  Once we got down to the deltoid and pectoralis muscle, there was no apparent cephalic vein present, as a result the rotator cuff interval had to be developed through an area of scar.  This created a significant amount of bleeding.  As a result a very slow and meticulous dissection was performed to isolate his coracoid and then his proximal humerus.  Care was taken to stay above the pectoralis minor and the conjoint tendon.  The deltoid had already started to scar down the proximal humerus as a result a very significant amount of dissection had to be performed to release the deltoid from proximal humerus.  Similarly, the deltoid insertion had to be released approximately 50% of its width to allow us enough mobility of the proximal humerus to be able to visualize the joint or the component.  It was clear that the patient had an avulsion of the subscapularis tendon as the tissue on the anterior aspect of the shoulder was very thin.  The muscle component of the subscapularis could be located approximately 1 cm off the glenoid rim and approximately 3 cm off the lesser tuberosity.  The soft tissue in this area was significantly scarred down to the conjoint tendon, which had to be very meticulously released.  The brachial plexus was identified as was the axillary nerve.  Once this was completed, an arthrotomy was then made leaving some tissue attached to the lesser tuberosity in case it was needed for closure later.  This revealed sanguineous fluid inside the joint.  We did not feel it was infected based upon the fluid that came from the joint.  The sutures for the subscapularis repair were still located in the proximal humerus with no tearing through the bone, which was fortunate because in that we could use the bone later for securing the sutures.  The remaining sutures were seen to be retracted medially to an area of the subscapularis as mentioned previously.  Some more capsule had to be released off the inferior neck in order for us to gain exposure during the scarring.  This was done also very meticulously.  The upper one half of the latissimus dorsi tendon was also released.  Once this was completed, the humerus could be subluxed enough laterally that we could remove the head.  This was done with no difficulty.  Fortunately, the humeral component stayed intact.  There were some exudates beneath the humeral head, which were somewhat mucinous.  However, these do not really appear to be infected, however, we sent them to pathology for a frozen section.  This frozen section later returned as possible purulent material.  I discussed this personally with the pathologist at that point.  We told him that the procedure is only 3 weeks old, but he was concerned that there might be more white blood cells in the tissue than he would expect.  As a result, all the mucinous exudates were carefully removed.  We also performed a fairly extensive synovectomy of the joint primarily to gain vision of the components, but also we irrigated the joint throughout the case with antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  At that point, we also had sent portions of this mucinous material to pathology for a stat Gram stain.  This came back as no organisms seen.  We also sent portions for culture and sensitivity both aerobic and anaerobic.,Once this was completed, attention was then directed to the glenoid.  The patient had significant amount of scar already.  The subscapularis itself was significantly scarred down to the anterior rim.  As a result, the adhesions along the anterior edge were released using a knife.  Also adhesions in the subcoracoid space area were released very carefully and meticulously to prevent any injury to the brachial plexus.  Two long retractors were placed medially to protect the brachial plexus during all portions of suturing of the subscapularis.  The subscapularis was then tagged with multiple number 2 Tycron sutures.  Adhesions were released circumferentially and it was found that with the arm in internal rotation about neutral degrees, the subscapularis could reach the calcar region without tension.  As a result, seven number 2 Tycron sutures were placed from the bicipital groove all the way down to the inferior calcar region of the humerus.  These all had excellent security in bone.  Once the joint had been debrided and irrigated, the real humeral head was then placed back on the proximal humerus.  Care was taken to remove fluid off the Morse taper.  The head was then impacted.  It should be noted that we tried multiple head sizes to see if a smaller or larger head size might be more appropriate for this patient.  Unfortunately, any of the larger head sizes would overstep the joint and any smaller sizes would not give good coverage to the proximal humerus.  As a result, it was felt to place the offset head back on the humerus, we did insert a new component as opposed to using the old component.  The old component was given to the family postoperatively.,With the arm in internal rotation, the Tycron sutures were then placed through the subscapularis tendon in the usual horizontal mattress fashion.  Also, it should be noted that the rotator cuff interval had to be released as part of the exposure.  We started the repair by closing the rotator cuff interval.  Anterior and posterior translation was then performed and was found to be very stable.  The remaining sutures were then secured through the subscapularis tendon taking care to make sure that very substantial bites were obtained.  This was then reinforced with the more flimsy tissue laterally being sewn into the tissue around the bicipital tuberosity essentially provided us with a two-layer repair of the subscapularis tendon.  After the tendon had been repaired, there was no tension on repair until 0 degrees external rotation was reached with the arm to the side.  Similarly with the arm abducted 90 degrees, tension was on repair at 0 degrees of external rotation.  It should be noted that the wound was thoroughly irrigated throughout with antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  The rotator cuff interval was closed with multiple number 2 Tycron sutures.  It was reinforced with 0 Vicryl sutures.  Two Hemovac drains were then placed inferiorly at the deltoid.  The deltopectoral interval was then closed with 0 Vicryl sutures.  A third drain was placed in the subcutaneous tissues to prevent any infections or any fluid collections.  This was sewn into place with the drain pulled out superiorly.  Once all the sutures have been secured and the drain visualized throughout this part of the closure, the drain was pulled distally until it was completely covered.  There were no signs that it had been tagged or hung up by any sutures.,The superficial subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin was closed with staples.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and a shoulder immobilizer.  The patient was sent to the intensive care unit in stable and satisfactory condition.,Due to the significant amount of scar and bleeding in this patient, a 22 modifier is being requested for this case.  This was a very difficult revision case and was significantly increased in technical challenges and challenges in the dissection and exposure of this implant compared to a standard shoulder replacement.  Similarly, the repair of the subscapularis tendon presented significantly more challenges than that of a standard rotator cuff repair because of the implant.  This was being dictated for insurance purposes only and reflects no inherent difficulties with this case.  The complexity and the time involved in this case was approximately 30% greater than that of a standard shoulder replacement or of a rotator cuff repair.  This is being dictated to indicate this was a revision case with significant amount of scar and bleeding due to the patient's situation with his pacemaker.  This patient also had multiple medical concerns, which increased the complexity of this case including the necessity to place him in intensive care unit postoperatively for observation.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Abnormal uterine bleeding.,2.  Status post spontaneous vaginal delivery.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Abnormal uterine bleeding.,2.  Status post spontaneous vaginal delivery.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Dilation and curettage (D&C).,2.  Hysteroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with paracervical block.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 10 cc.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is a 17-year-old African-American female that presents 7 months status post spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications at that time.  The patient has had abnormal uterine bleeding since her delivery with an ultrasound showing a 6 cm x 6 cm fundal mass suspicious either for retained products or endometrial polyp.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was consented and seen in the preoperative suite.  She was taken to the operative suite, placed in a dorsal lithotomy position, and placed under IV sedation.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with the red Robinson catheter which produced approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was done, was performed by Dr. X and Dr. Z.  The uterus was found to be anteverted, mobile, fully involuted to a pre-pregnancy stage.  The cervix and vagina were grossly normal with no obvious masses or deformities.  A weighted speculum was placed in the posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.,The uterus was sounded to 8 cm.  The cervix was sterilely dilated with Hank dilator and then Hagar dilator.  At the time of blunt dilation, it was noticed that the dilator passed posteriorly with greater ease than it had previously.  The dilation was discontinued at that time because it was complete and the hysteroscope was placed into the uterus.  Under direct visualization, the ostia were within normal limits.  The endometrial lining was hyperplastic, however, there was no evidence of retained products or endometrial polyps.  The hyperplastic tissue did not appear to have calcification or other abnormalities.  There was a small area of the lower uterine segment posteriorly that was suspicious for endometrial perforation, however this area was hemostatic, no evidence of bowel involvement and was approximately 1 x 1 cm in nature.  The hysteroscope was removed and a sharp curette was placed intrauterine very carefully using a anterior wall for guidance.  Endometrial curettings were obtained and the posterior aspect suspicious for perforation was gently probed and seemed to have clamped down since the endometrial curetting.  The endometrial sampling was placed on Telfa pad and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  A rectal exam was performed at the end of the procedure which showed no hematoma formation in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was a normal consistency of the cervix and the normal step-off.  The uterine curette was removed as well as the vulsellum tenaculum and the weighted speculum.  The cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The patient was taken off the dorsal lithotomy position and recovered from her IV sedation in the recovery room.  The patient will be sent home once stable from anesthesia.  She will be instructed to followup in the office in two weeks for discussion of the pathologic report of the endometrial curettings.  The patient is sent home on Tylenol #3 prescription as she is allergic to Motrin.  The patient is instructed to refrain from intercourse douching or using tampons for the next two weeks.  The patient is also instructed to contact us if she has any problems with further bleeding, fevers, or difficulty with urination.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.,2.  Severe intraabdominal adhesions.,3.  Retroperitoneal fibrosis.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions.,2.  Attempted laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,3.  Open laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 62-year-old female with a history of right ureteropelvic junction obstruction with chronic indwelling double-J ureteral stent.  The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.  We placed the patient on IV antibiotics and pain medications.  We will obtain KUB and x-rays for stent placement.  Further recommendations to follow.

Neck pain, progressive (723.1) with right greater than left radiculopathy (723.4), surgical findings confirmed.,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and C6-C7 for neural decompression (63075, 63076).,2.  Anterior interbody fusion at C5-C6 and C6-C7 (22554, 22585) utilizing Bengal cages x2 (22851).,3.  Anterior instrumentation by Uniplate construction C5, C6, and C7 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,OPERATIONS: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position where general anesthesia was administered.  Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues.  Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7.  Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen.  This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well.  This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed.  At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam.  Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7.  These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size.  The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc.  The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.,Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition.  At the conclusion of the case, all instrument, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct.  There were no intraoperative complications of any type.

The patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07.  This resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow.  She was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time MRI of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear.  She did have a previous MRI of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left C6-C7 level.  Based on this, negative MRI of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 level.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her.  Risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics.  However, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room.  Should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft.  There is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery.  There is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid.  There is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure.  She understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case.  The EMGs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension.  The head was supported on a foam doughnut.  The right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side.  A linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles.  Dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply.  A localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 interspace.  Proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C6 and C7.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  The annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr.  The interior endplate of C6 and superior endplate of C7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of C6 and the posterior superior edge of C7.  There was note of a new osteophyte on the left C6-C7 foramen.  This was carefully drilled down.  After decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders.  They were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with Gelfoam.  After this was completed, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with Vitoss.  The plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws.  Irrigation of the area was done.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis.  The wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site.  C-collar was placed and the patient was transferred to Recovery after extubation.

He tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit in stable condition.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevated post A-wave at 25 mm of Mercury with no aortic valve systolic gradient on pullback.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is unremarkable. The left anterior descending has 30 to 40% narrowing with tortuosity in its proximal portion, patent first septal perforator branch. The first diagonal branch is a 2 mm vessel with a 90% ostial stenosis. The second diagonal branch is unremarkable, as are the tiny distal diagonal branches. The intermediate branch is a small, normal vessel. The ostial non-dominant circumflex has some contrast thinning, but no stenosis, normal obtuse marginal branch, and small AV sulcus circumflex branch.,II. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large, dominant vessel which gives off large posterior descending and posterolateral left ventricular branches. There are luminal irregularities, less than 25%, within the proximal to mid vessel. Some contrast thinning is present in the distal RCA just before the bifurcation into posterior descending and posterolateral branches. A 25%, smooth narrowing at the origin of the posterior descending branch. Posterolateral branch is unremarkable and quite large, with secondary and tertiary branches.,III.

Left ventricular function is reduced with ejection fraction 40 to 45% with inferior wall motion abnormality.,PLAN:, Medical treatment, including Plavix and nitrates, in addition to beta blocker, aspirin, and aggressive lipid reduction.
HISTORY:,  The patient is 14 months old, comes in with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing.  Difficulty breathing began last night.  He was taken to Emergency Department where he got some Xopenex, given a prescription for amoxicillin and discharged home.  They were home for about an hour when he began to get worse and they drove here to Children's Hospital.  He has a history of reactive airway disease.  He has been seen here twice in the last month on 10/04/2007 and 10/20/2007, both times with some wheezing.  He was diagnosed with pneumonia back on 06/12/2007 here in the Emergency Department but was not admitted at that time.  He has been on albuterol off and on over that period.  He has had fever overnight.  No vomiting, no diarrhea.  Increased work of breathing with retractions and audible wheezes noted and thus brought to the Emergency Department.  Normal urine output.  No rashes have been seen.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , As noted above.  No hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies.,MEDICATIONS: , Xopenex.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up-to-date.,BIRTH HISTORY:,  The child was full term, no complications, home with mom.

Extraocular movements are intact.  The TMs are clear.  The nares show some dry secretions.  Audible congestion and wheezing is noted.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Throat is clear.  No oral lesions noted.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Show inspiratory and expiratory wheezes in all fields.  Audible wheezes are noted.  There are intercostal and subcostal retractions and suprasternal muscle use is noted.,HEART:  Shows tachycardia.  Regular rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding.  No rebound.  No hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  Capillary refill is brisk.  Good distal pulses.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Moves all 4 extremities equally and normally.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The child has an IV placed.  I felt the child was dehydrated on examination.  We gave 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over one hour.  The child was given Solu-Medrol 2 mg/kg IV.  He was initially started on unit dose albuterol and Atrovent but high-dose albuterol for continuous nebulization was ordered.,A portable chest x-ray was done showing significant peribronchial thickening bilaterally.  Normal heart size.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.  After 3 unit dose of albuterol/Atrovent breathing treatments, there was much better air exchange bilaterally but still with inspiratory/expiratory wheezes and high-dose continuous albuterol was started at that time.  The child was monitored closely while on high-dose albuterol and slowly showed improvement resulting in only expiratory wheezes after one hour.  The child's pulse ox on breathing treatments with 100% oxygen was 100%.  Respiratory rate remained about 40 to 44 breaths per minute indicating tachypnea.  The child's color improved with oxygen therapy, and the capillary refill was always less than 2 seconds.,The child has failed outpatient therapy at this time.  After 90 minutes of continuous albuterol treatment, the child still has expiratory wheezes throughout.  After I removed the oxygen, the pulse ox was down at 91% indicating hypoxia.  The child has a normal level of alertness; however, has not had any vomiting here.  I spoke with Dr. X, on call for hospitalist service.  She has come down and evaluated the patient.  We both feel that since this child had two ER visits this last month, one previous ER visit within the last 5 hours, we should admit the child for continued albuterol treatments, IV steroids, and asthma teaching for the family.  The child is admitted in a stable condition.,DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,Ruled out pneumothorax, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup.,TIME SPENT:  ,Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.,IMPRESSION:  ,Status asthmaticus, hypoxia.,PLAN:  ,Admitted to Pediatrics.

XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear Dr. XYZ:,Thank you for your kind referral for patient ABC.  Mr. ABC is being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.  The patient states he has no visual complaints.,On examination, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally.  The patient's visual fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect and applanation pressures are 15 mmHg bilaterally.  On slit lamp examination, the patient has a normal anterior segment with 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  On dilated examination, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.  He has fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratios OU.  His intraocular pressures were within normal limits in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternatives of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photos of his optic nerves for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong findings suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific questions or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.  I have recommended him to follow up with you for continued examination, continued check-ups, and should you find any other abnormal findings, I would be happy to address those again.,Again, thank you for your referral of Mr. ABC.,Sincerely,,

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Volar laceration to right ring finger with possible digital nerve injury with possible flexor tendon injury.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Laceration to right ring finger with partial laceration to the ulnar slip of the FDS which is the flexor digitorum superficialis.,2.  25% laceration to the flexor digitorum profundus of the right ring finger and laceration 100% of the ulnar digital nerve to the right ring finger.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Repair of nerve and tendon, right ring finger.,2.  Exploration of digital laceration.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 cc.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,57 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION:  ,To PACU in stable condition.,BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 13-year-old male who had sustained a laceration from glass and had described numbness and tingling in his right ring finger.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , After wound exploration, it was found there was a 100% laceration to the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle.  The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.  Overall prognosis is good.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bilateral hydroceles.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bilateral hydroceles.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral scrotal hydrocelectomies, large for both, and 0.5% Marcaine wound instillation, 30 mL given.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: , 800 mL.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , A 0.25-inch Penrose drains x4.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 17-year-old boy, who has had fairly large hydroceles noted for some time.  Finally, he has decided to have them get repaired.  Plan is for surgical repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then shaved, prepped, and then sterilely prepped and draped.  IV antibiotics were given.  Ancef 1 g given.  A scrotal incision was then made in the right hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  Once we got to the hydrocele sac itself, we then opened and delivered the testis, drained clear fluid.  There was moderate amount of scarring on the testis itself from the tunica vaginalis.  It was then wrapped around the back and sutured in place with a running suture of 4-0 chromic in a Lord maneuver.  Once this was done, a drain was placed in the base of the scrotum and then the testis was placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  A similar procedure was performed on the left, which has also had a hydrocele of the cord, which were both addressed and closed with Lord maneuver similarly.  This testis also was normal but had moderate amount of scarring on the tunic vaginalis from this.  A similar drain was placed.  The testes were then placed back into the scrotum in a proper orientation, and the local wound instillation and wound block was then placed using 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  The skin was then sutured with a running interlocking suture of 3-0 Vicryl and the drains were sutured to place with 3-0 Vicryl.  Bacitracin dressing, ABD dressing, and jock strap were placed.  The patient was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007.  At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy.  Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks.  She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007.  She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y.  Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.,On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.  She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion.  Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.,She had surgical resection done yesterday.  The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis.  At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.,Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted.  Radial margin was 0.1 mm.  Other margins were 5 and 6 mm.  Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.,Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs.  The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1.  The ovaries were normal.  An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She has otherwise been feeling well.  She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy.  She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.  She was eating well up until the time of her surgery.  She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June.  She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.,MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:,  None.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , No significant medical problem.  She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks.  She has no prior surgeries.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s.  A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week.  She does not smoke now.  She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine.  She is married and has no children.  An IUD was recently placed.  She works as an esthetician.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45.  This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history.  She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.  Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44.  Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago.  Otherwise, he has no medical problem.  Mother is aged 82 and healthy.  She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,GENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.,SKIN:  Warm and dry.  She has no jaundice.,LYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.,LUNGS:  There is no respiratory distress.,CARDIAC:  Regular rate.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and mildly tender.  Dressings are clean and dry.,EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema is noted.  Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.,LABORATORY DATA:,  White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6.  Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133.  Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1.  She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled.  Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.,A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.,Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.,She has a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available.  She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.  If not, those can be drawn tomorrow.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4.,GRAFTS PERFORMED: , LIMA to LAD, left radial artery from the aorta to the PDA, left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman, who presented with six-month history of progressively worsening exertional angina.  He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  Dressings were applied.  The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  He tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  Bypass time was 120 minutes.  The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nasal septal deviation.,2.  Bilateral internal nasal valve collapse.,3.  Bilateral external nasal valve collapse.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nasal septal deviation.,2.  Bilateral internal nasal valve collapse.,3.  Bilateral external nasal valve collapse.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Revision septoplasty.,2.  Repair of internal nasal valve collapse using auricular cartilage.,3.  Repair of bilateral external nasal valve collapse using auricular cartilage.,4.  Harvest of right auricular cartilage.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 20 mL.,IV FLUIDS: , Include a liter of crystalloid fluid.,URINE OUTPUT: , None.,FINDINGS: , Include that of significantly deviated septum with postoperative changes and a significant septal spur along the floor.  There is also evidence of bilateral internal as well as external nasal valve collapse.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who had undergone a previous septorhinoplasty after significant trauma in his 20s.  He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.  He was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE,1.  Thromboendarterectomy of right common, external, and internal carotid artery utilizing internal shunt and Dacron patch angioplasty closure.,2.  Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 utilizing left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and reverse autogenous saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass,cold blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade and retrograde, for myocardial protection, placement of temporary pacing wires.,DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room, placed in supine position.  Adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  Appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  The chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The greater saphenous vein was harvested from the right upper leg through interrupted skin incisions and was prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushing with vein solution.  The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu, and running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin, and later wrapped.  A median sternotomy incision was made and the left internal mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff at the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The sternum was closed.  A right carotid incision was made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carried down to and through the platysma.  The deep fascia was divided.  The facial vein was divided between clamps and tied with 2-0 silk.  The common carotid artery, takeoff of the external and internal carotid arteries were dissected free, with care taken to identify and preserve the hypoglossal and vagus nerves.  The common carotid artery was double-looped with umbilical tape, takeoff of the external was looped with a heavy silk, distal internal was double-looped with a heavy silk.  Shunts were prepared.  A patch was prepared.  Heparin 50 mg was given IV.  Clamp was placed on the beginning of the takeoff of the external and the proximal common carotid artery.  Distal internal was held with a forceps.  Internal carotid artery was opened with 11-blade.  Potts scissors were then used to extend the aortotomy through the lesion into good internal carotid artery beyond.  The shunt was placed and proximal and distal snares were tightened.  Endarterectomy was carried out under direct vision in the common carotid artery and the internal reaching a fine, feathery distal edge using eversion on the external.  All loose debris was removed and Dacron patch was then sutured in place with running 6-0 Prolene suture, removing the shunt just prior to completing the suture line.  Suture line was completed and the neck was packed.,The pericardium was opened.  A pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was heparinized for cardiopulmonary bypass, cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula.  A retrograde cardioplegia cannula was placed with a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene into the coronary sinus, and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed in the ascending aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  The ascending aorta was cross-clamped and cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 5 cc per kg.  This was followed sumping of the ascending aorta and retrograde cardioplegia, a total of 5 cc per kg to the coronary sinus.  The obtuse marginal 1 coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The obtuse marginal 2 was not felt to be suitable for bypass, therefore, the posterior descending of the right coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture to reverse autogenous saphenous vein.  The vein was cut to length.  The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The anterior descending was identified and opened. the mammary was then sutured to this with running 8-0 Prolene suture.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Briefly, this is a 17-year-old male, who has had problems with dysphagia to solids and recently had food impacted in the lower esophagus.  He is now having upper endoscopy to evaluate the esophagus after edema and inflammation from the food impaction has resolved, to look for any stricture that may need to be dilated, or any other mucosal abnormality.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , EGD.,PREP: , Cetacaine spray, 100 mcg of fentanyl IV, and 5 mg of Versed IV.,FINDINGS:,  The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the esophagus, and the entire length of the esophagus was dotted with numerous, white, punctate lesions, suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis.  There were come concentric rings present.  There was no erosion or flame hemorrhage, but there was some friability in the distal esophagus.  Biopsies throughout the entire length of the esophagus from 25-40 cm were obtained to look for eosinophilic esophagitis.  There was no stricture or Barrett mucosa.  The bony and the antrum of the stomach are normal without any acute peptic lesions.  Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope in the body of the stomach revealed a normal cardia.  There were no acute lesions and no evidence of ulcer, tumor, or polyp.  The pylorus was easily entered, and the first, second, and third portions of the duodenum are normal.  Adverse reactions:  None.,FINAL IMPRESSION:  ,Esophageal changes suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis.  Biopsies throughout the length of the esophagus were obtained for microscopic analysis.  There was no evidence of stricture, Barrett, or other abnormalities in the upper GI tract.
HISTORY: , The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in a setting of hypokalemia, incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with CPAP, chocolate/caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress.  Despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with Diltiazem IV she has maintained atrial fibrillation.  I have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.  After an in depth discussion of the procedure (please see my initial consultation for further details) I asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday.  The patient declined.  I invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol including proper identification of the patient, physician, procedure, documentation, and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff.  The patient participated actively in this.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect.  She was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the AP position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after Diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm.  This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation.  The patient's electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future, as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with CPAP and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings, as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress.  She will be discharged on her usual robust AV nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily and digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily and to be clear she does have a permanent pacemaker implanted.  She will follow-up with her regular cardiologist, Dr. X, for whom I am covering this weekend.,This was all discussed in detail with the patient, as well as her granddaughter with the patient's verbal consent at the bedside.
FINDINGS:,Axial scans were performed from L1 to S2 and reformatted images were obtained in the sagittal and coronal planes.,Preliminary scout film demonstrates anterior end plate spondylosis at T11-12 and T12-L1.,L1-2: There is normal disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, very minimal vacuum change with no posterior annular disc bulging or protrusion.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Chronic hypertrophic adenotonsillitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Chronic hypertrophic adenotonsillitis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  Adenotonsillectomy, primary, patient under age 12.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , This patient was brought from the holding area and did receive preoperative antibiotics of Cleocin as well as IV Decadron.  She was placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without difficulty.  In the holding area, her allergies were reviewed.  It is unclear whether she is actually allergic to penicillin.  Codeine caused her to be excitable, but she did not actually have an allergic reaction to codeine.  She might be allergic to BACTRIM and SULFA.  After positioning a small shoulder roll and draping sterilely, McIvor mouthgag, #3 blade was inserted and suspended from the Mayo stand.  There was no bifid uvula or submucous cleft.  She had 3+ cryptic tonsils with significant debris in the tonsillar crypts.  Injection at each peritonsillar area with 0.25% with Marcaine with 1:200,000 Epinephrine, approximately 1.5 mL total volume.  The left superior tonsillar pole was then grasped with curved Allis forceps.  _______ incision and dissection in the tonsillar capsule and hemostasis and removal of the tonsil was obtained with Coblation Evac Xtra Wand on 7/3.  Mouthgag was released, reopened, no bleeding was seen.  The right tonsil was then removed in the same fashion.  The mouthgag released, reopened, and no bleeding was seen.  Small red rubber catheter in the nasal passage was used to retract the soft palate.  She had mild-to-moderate adenoidal tissue residual.  It was removed with Coblation Evac Xtra gently curved Wand on 9/5.  Red rubber catheter was then removed.  Mouthgag was again released, reopened, no bleeding was seen.  Orogastric suction carried out with only scant clear stomach contents.  Mouthgag was then removed.  Teeth and lips were inspected and were in their preoperative condition.  The patient then awakened, extubated, and taken to recovery room in good condition.,TOTAL BLOOD LOSS FROM TONSILLECTOMY: , Less than 2 mL.,TOTAL BLOOD LOSS FROM ADENOIDECTOMY: , Less than 2 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative events or complications occurred.,PLAN:,  Family will be counseled postoperatively.  Postoperatively, the patient will be on Zithromax oral suspension 500 mg daily for 5 to 7 days, Lortab Elixir for pain.  _______ and promethazine if needed for nausea and vomiting.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cataract, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cataract, right eye.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Phacoemulsification with IOL, right eye.,ANESTHESIA:,  Topical with MAC.,COMPLICATIONS,:  None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After appropriate consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and then prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion per Ophthalmology.  A lid speculum was placed in the right eye after which a supersharp was used to make a stab incision at the 4 o'clock position through which 2% preservative-free Xylocaine was injected followed by Viscoat.  A 2.75-mm keratome then made a stab incision at the 2 o'clock position through which an anterior capsulorrhexis was performed using cystotome and Utrata.  BSS on blunt cannula, hydrodissector, and spun the nucleus after which phacoemulsification divided the nucleus in 3 quadrants each was subsequently cracked and removed through phacoemulsification I&A.  Healon was injected into the posterior capsule and a XXX lens was then placed with a shooter into the posterior capsule and rotated into position with I&A, which then removed all remaining cortex as well as viscoelastic material.  BSS on blunt cannula hydrated all wounds, which were noted to be free of leak and lid speculum was removed.  Under microscope, the anterior chamber being soft and well formed.  Pred Forte, Vigamox, and Iopidine were placed in the eye.  A shield was placed over the eye.  The patient was followed to recovery where he was noted to be in good condition.
SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.

Hypermenorrhea.,3.  Desire for future fertility.,4.  Failed conservative medical therapy.,5.  Possible adenomyosis.,6.  Left hydrosalpinx.,7.  Suspicion for endometriosis.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Dilation and curettage (D&C).,2.  Laparoscopy.,3.  Harmonic scalpel ablation of lesion which is suspicious for endometriosis.,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal tube.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 20 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATIONS: , This is a 35-year-old Caucasian female gravida 1, para 0-0-1-0 with a history of spontaneous abortion.  This patient had approximately greater than ten years of chronic pelvic pain with dysmenorrhea which has significantly affected her activities of daily living.  Symptoms have not improved with prescription of oral contraceptives.,The patient has had one prior surgery for a left ovarian cystectomy done by laparoscopy in 1996.  The cyst was not diagnosed as an endometrioma.  The patient does desire future fertility; however, would like a definitive diagnosis.  Conservative medical therapy was offered i.e.  Lupron or repeat oral contraceptives, but declined.,FINDINGS:,  Bimanual exam reveals a small retroverted uterus which is easily mobile.  There were no adnexal masses.  The cervix was normal on palpation.  A fibrotic band was noted at the internal os during dilation.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus was found to be small with mild spongy texture.  On palpation, the right ovary and adnexa were grossly normal with no evidence of endometriosis.  The left ovary was grossly normal.  The left fallopian tube had a mild hydrosalpinx present.  The left uterosacral ligament had three to four 1 mm to 2 mm lesions that were vesicular in nature consistent with endometriosis.  The vesicouterine reflection in the anterior aspect of the uterus were within normal limits as were the posterior cul-de-sac.  The liver appeared grossly normal.  There were no obvious pelvic adhesions.  The left internal inguinal ring is somewhat patent, however, there is no bowel or viscera protruding through it.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was seen in the preop suite.  History was reviewed and all questions were answered.  The patient was then taken to the operative suite where she was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube.  She was placed in a dorsal lithotomy position in Allen stirrups.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter producing approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was performed by Dr. X, Dr. Y, and Dr. Z with above findings noted.  A sterile weighted speculum was placed in posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior aspect of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  There was an attempt to place the uterine sound through the external and internal cervical os, however, secondary to a fibrotic band at the internal os that was impossible.  A #9 dilator was allowed to remain in the cervix for minimal manipulation while attention was then turned to the abdomen.  An infraumbilical incision was made using skin scalpel.  The Veress needle was placed and CO2 was insufflated.  It was immediately noticed that the pressures were inconsistent with intraabdominal insufflation and the CO2 was discontinued and Veress needle was completely removed.  A second attempt placement of the Veress needle into the abdomen was successful and CO2 was insufflated approximately 3 liters with minimal intraabdominal pressure.  The #12 port was placed and the laparoscope was inserted.  Attention was then turned back to the uterus and with the assistance of current hemostat to bluntly dissect the fibrotic band of the internal os.,Successful sounding of the uterus showed an 8-cm uterus that was in a retroverted position.  The cervix was serially dilated using Hank dilators to allow for introduction of the sharp curette.  A curettage was then performed and specimen of the endometrium was sent for pathologic evaluation.  This procedure was performed under direct laparoscopic visualization.  Laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis was performed and the above findings noted.  A second abdominal incision was performed suprapubically using a skin scalpel and the Veress needle was placed through the incision successfully under direct visualization.  A #5 port was then placed through the sheath and the uterine manipulator was used to complete visualization.  The manipulator was then removed and the Harmonic scalpel was placed through the #5 port.  The Harmonic scalpel was used then to ablate the 1 mm vesicular lesions on the left uterosacral ligament.  The lesions were suspect for endometriosis, however, they were not diagnostic of endometriosis.  There was also present a 3 mm to 5 mm submucosal uterine fibroid on the right lower uterine segment.  The Harmonic scalpel was removed from the abdomen as was the #5 port.  The incision was internally found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope was then removed from the abdomen.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced into the #12 port and the #12 port was removed from the abdomen.  The uterine manipulator was removed from the uterus and the cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was then removed.  The patient taken out of dorsal lithotomy position.  She was recovered from general anesthesia and taken to the postoperative suite for complete recovery.  The patient's discharge instructions will include a followup in one to two weeks in Dr. X's office for discussion of pathology.  Her family was notified of the findings.  She will be instructed not to have intercourse or use tampons or douche for the next two weeks.  The patient will be sent home with a prescription for Darvocet for pain.

The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Nissen fundoplication.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.,The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The,52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus, right foot.,2.  Hammertoe, bilateral third, fourth, and fifth toes.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral fifth toes.,3.  Distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral third and fourth toes.,4.  Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities.
COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL STATUS EVALUATION,REASON FOR REFERRAL/GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:,  The patient was referred for a Comprehensive Mental Status Evaluation for the purpose of assisting in the determination of eligibility for Disability.  He is a 43-year-old married, white male who came unaccompanied to the evaluation.  He drove himself suggesting that he drives regularly.  He reportedly has been on Disability since around 2002.  He was a good historian, freely offering information.  He was dressed and groomed casually, yet neat and appropriate in appearance.

He has these panic symptoms quite regularly and they have occurred ever since 1997.  That was the time that he engaged in some type of sexual assault with a minor and spent about a week in jail.  No phobic processes were suggested.  No psychotic symptoms were revealed.  He denied hallucinations and no delusional material was elicited.  Thought content was appropriate to mood and circumstances.,The claimant was oriented in all spheres.  He evidenced adequate memory for both recent and remote events.  He was able to recall 3 of 3 words after a 1 minute and 10 minute delay.  Fair sustained attention and concentration skills were shown.  He was able to spell a word backward and performed a serial 7 subtraction task affectively.  Basic calculation skills were intact and no language-based dysfunction was noted.  Social judgment was also intact as he gave a good response to finding a wallet in the street, "find who the owner was, bring it to the police station or contact the person," and to seeing smoke in a theater, "Get a hold of staff so they could evacuate."  Adequate conceptual abilities was shown with similarity comparisons.  Somewhat limited abstraction was shown with proverb interpretation, glass houses, "don't do anything you're not supposed to do."  Premorbid intellect is estimated to be at least in the average range.  Insight regarding his situation was fair.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,Axis I:  Major Depression, recurrent, moderate.  Panic disorder without agoraphobia.,SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS:,  Based on this evaluation, I believe the claimant's current condition would continue to result in difficulty with work-related activities.  He continues to show significant problems with depression and anxiety.  He is quite withdrawn and socially isolated and has panic attacks whenever he is confronted with public situations.  He relies on his wife to take care of most all household task.  He engages in very few simple, routine and repetitive activities. Cognitive capacity was relatively intact suggesting no significant problems in maintaining focus and pace with task.,RECOMMENDATIONS/CAPABILITY:,  The claimant was strongly encouraged to get some additional help for his emotional problems.  He would benefit from having someone to speak with on a regular basis and some referrals were offered. ,It is the opinion of this examiner that the claimant is capable of handling his own funds if so assigned.
CAUSE OF DEATH:,1.  Acute respiratory failure.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:,1.  Acute respiratory failure, probably worsened by aspiration.,2.  Acute on chronic renal failure.,3.  Non-Q wave myocardial infarction.,4.  Bilateral lung masses.,5.  Occlusive carotid disease.,6.  Hypertension.,7.  Peripheral vascular disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,This 80-year-old patient with a history of COPD had had recurrent admissions over the past few months.  The patient was admitted again on 12/15/08, after he had been discharged the previous day.  Came in with acute on chronic respiratory failure, with CO2 of 57.  The patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation.  RVR with a rapid ventricular response of 160 beats per minute.  The patient was on COPD exacerbation and CHF due to rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient's heart rate was controlled with IV Cardizem.  Troponin was consistent with non-Q wave MI.  The patient was treated medically transfer to catheterize the patient to evaluate her coronary artery disease.  Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction, normal left and right side, but stage 3 restrictive physiology.  There was also prosthetic aortic valve.  The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and was intubated.  Pulmonary was managed by Critical Care, Dr. X.,The patient was successfully extubated.  Was tapered from IV steroids and put on p.o. steroids.  The patient's renal function has stabilized with a creatinine of between 2.1 and 2.3.  There was contemplation as to whether left heart catheterization should proceed since Nephrology was concerned about the patient's renal status.  Wife decided catheterization should be canceled and the patient managed conservatively.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor.  While in telemetry floor, the patient's renal function started deteriorating, went up from 2.08 to 2.67 in two days.  The patient had nausea and vomiting.  Was unable to tolerate p.o.  Was put on cautious hydration.  The patient went into acute respiratory distress.  Intubation showed the patient had aspirated.  He was in acute respiratory failure with bronchospasms and exacerbation of COPD.  X-ray of chest did not show any infiltrate, but showed dilatation of the stomach.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit because of acute respiratory failure, was intubated by Critical Care, Dr. X.  The patient was put on the vent.  Overnight, the patient's condition did not improve.  Continued to be severely hypoxic.,The patient expired on the morning of 12/24/08 from acute respiratory failure.
EXAM: , Two views of the pelvis.,HISTORY:,  This is a patient post-surgery, 2-1/2 months.  The patient has a history of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) bilaterally.,TECHNIQUE: , Frontal and lateral views of the hip and pelvis were evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YYYY.  Lateral view of the right hip was evaluated.,FINDINGS:,  Frontal view of the pelvis and a lateral view of the right hip were evaluated and correlated with the patient's most recent priors dated MM/DD/YYYY.  Current films reveal stable appearing post-surgical changes.  Again demonstrated is a single intramedullary screw across the left femoral neck and head.  There are 2 intramedullary screws through the greater trochanter of the right femur.  There is a lucency along the previous screw track extending into the right femoral head and neck.  There has been interval removal of cutaneous staples and/or surgical clips.  These were previously seen along the lateral aspect of the right hip joint.,Deformity related to the previously described slipped capital femoral epiphysis is again seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Stable-appearing right hip joint status-post pinning.,2.  Interval removal of skin staples as described above.
TIME SEEN: , 0734 hours and 1034 hours.,TOTAL RECORDING TIME: , 27 hours 4 minutes.,PATIENT HISTORY: , This is a 43-year-old female with a history of events concerning for seizures.  Video EEG monitoring is performed to capture events and/or identify etiology.,VIDEO EEG DIAGNOSES,1.  AWAKE:  Normal.,2.  SLEEP:  No activation.,3.  CLINICAL EVENTS:  None.,DESCRIPTION: , Approximately 27 hours of continuous 21-channel digital video EEG monitoring was performed.  The waking background is unchanged from that previously reported.  Hyperventilation produced no changes in the resting record.  Photic stimulation failed to elicit a well-developed photic driving response.,Approximately five-and-half hours of spontaneous intermittent sleep was obtained.  Sleep spindles were present and symmetric.,The patient had no clinical events during the recording.,CLINICAL INTERPRETATION:  ,This is normal video EEG monitoring for a patient of this age.  No interictal epileptiform activity was identified.  The patient had no clinical events during the recording.  Clinical correlation is required.
ALLOWED CONDITIONS:,  726.31 right medial epicondylitis; 354.0 right carpal tunnel syndrome.,CONTESTED CONDITIONS:,  354.2 right cubital tunnel syndrome.,EMPLOYER:,  ABCD,  ,I examined Xxxxx today for the allowed conditions and also the contested conditions listed above.  I obtained her history from company medical records and performed an examination.  She is a 38-year-old laborer who states that she was injured on April 26, 2006, which according to the FROI (the injury occurred over a period of time from performing normal job processes such as putting bumpers on cars, gas caps and doors on cars).  She denies having any symptoms prior to the accident April 26, 2006.  She is right handed.  She used a tennis elbow brace, hand exercises, physical therapy, and Vicodin.  She received treatment from Dr. X and also Dr. Y,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  June 27, 2006, EMG and nerve conduction velocity right upper extremity showed a moderate right carpal tunnel syndrome.  No evidence of a right cervical radiculopathy or ulnar neuropathy at the wrist or elbow.  January 29, 2007, EMG right upper extremity was normal and there was a normal nerve conduction velocity.  At the time of the examination, she complained of a constant pain in the olecranon and distal triceps with tingling in the right long, ring and small fingers, and night pain.  The pain was accentuated by gripping or opening the jar.  She is taking four Aleve a day and currently does not have any other treatment.,RECORDS REVIEWED: , Injury and illness incident report, US Healthworks records; Z physician review; Y office notes; X office notes who noted that on examination of the right elbow that the ulnar nerve subluxed with flexion and extension of the elbow.,EXAMINATION: , Examination of her right elbow revealed no measurable atrophy of the upper arm.  She was markedly tender over the medial epicondyle, but also the olecranon and distal process and she was exquisitely tender over the ulnar nerve.  I did not detect subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension.  With this, she was extremely tender in this area.  There is no instability of the elbow.  Range of motion was 0 to 145 degrees, flexion 90 degrees of pronation and supination.  The elbow flexion test was positive.  There is normal motor power in the elbow and also on the right hand, specifically in the ulnar intrinsics.  There was diminished sensation on the right ring and small fingers, specifically the ulnar side of the ring finger of the entire small finger.  There was no wasting of the intrinsics.  No clawing of the hand.  Examination of the right wrist revealed extension 45 degrees, flexion 45 degrees, radial deviation 15 degrees, and ulnar deviation 35 degrees.  She was tender over the dorsum of the hand over the ulnar head and the volar aspect of the wrist.  Wrist flexion causes paresthesias on the right ring and small fingers.  Grasp was weak.  There was no sign of causalgia, but no measurable atrophy of the forearm.  No reflex changes.,QUESTION:,  Ms. Xxxxx has filed an application of additional allowance of right cubital tunnel syndrome.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records or diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER:,  Yes.  She has a positive elbow flexion test and she is markedly tender over the ulnar nerve at the elbow and also has diminished sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution, specifically in the entire right small finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.  I did not find the subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension with Dr. X did previously find on his examination.,QUESTION: , If you find these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury?,ANSWER: , Yes.  Repeated flexion and extension would irritate the ulnar nerve particularly if it was subluxing which it could very well have which Dr. X objectively identified on his examination.  Therefore, I believe it is a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Ms. Xxxxx's injury or disability is caused by natural deterioration of tissue, organ or part of the body?,ANSWER: , No.,QUESTION:,  In addition, if you find that the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries that could have contributed to Ms. Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER: , It is possible that direct injury to the ulnar nerve at the elbow could cause this syndrome; however, there is no history of this and the records do not indicate an injury of this type.,QUESTION: ,
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Recurrent re-infected sebaceous cyst of abdomen.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Abscess secondary to retained foreign body.,2.  Incisional hernia.,PROCEDURES,1.  Excision of abscess, removal of foreign body.,2.  Repair of incisional hernia.,ANESTHESIA: , LMA.,INDICATIONS: , Patient is a pleasant 37-year-old gentleman who has had multiple procedures including a laparotomy related to trauma.  The patient has had a recurrently infected cyst of his mass at the superior aspect of his incision, which he says gets larger and then it drains internally, causing him to be quite ill.  He presented to my office and I recommended that he undergo exploration of this area and removal.  The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.,FINDINGS:,  The patient was found upon excision of the cyst that it contained a large Prolene suture, which is multiply knotted as it always is; beneath this was a very small incisional hernia, the hernia cavity, which contained omentum; the hernia was easily repaired.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of an LMA anesthetic, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  The puncta of the wound lesion was infiltrated with methylene blue and peroxide.  The lesion was excised and the existing scar was excised using an ellipse and using a tenotomy scissors, the cyst was excised down to its base.  In doing so, we identified a large Prolene suture within the wound and followed this cyst down to its base at which time we found that it contained omentum and was in fact overlying a small incisional hernia.  The cyst was removed in its entirety, divided from the omentum using a Metzenbaum and tying with 2-0 silk ties.  The hernia repair was undertaken with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture with simple sutures.  The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular and Steri-Strips.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Dressings were applied and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Right heart catheterization.,INDICATION: , Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right internal jugular region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right internal jugular vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vessel without resistance.  Small nick was then made in the skin and the needle was removed.  An #8.5 French venous sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted to 20 cm and the balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was advanced into the right atrium through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.  Pulmonary artery saturation was obtained.  The Swan was then kept in place for the patient to be transferred to the ICU for further medical titration.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.,FINDINGS:,  Body surface area equals 2.04, hemoglobin equals 9.3, O2 is at 2 liters nasal cannula.  Pulmonary artery saturation equals 37.8.  Pulse oximetry on 2 liters nasal cannula equals 93%.  Right atrial pressure is 8, right ventricular pressure equals 59/9, pulmonary artery pressure equals 61/31 with mean of 43, pulmonary artery wedge pressure equals 21, cardiac output equals 3.3 by the Fick method, cardiac index is 1.6 by the Fick method, systemic vascular resistance equals 1821, and transpulmonic gradient equals 22.,IMPRESSION:  ,Exam and Swan findings consistent with low perfusion given that the mixed venous O2 is only 38% on current medical therapy as well as elevated right-sided filling pressures and a high systemic vascular resistance.,PLAN: , Given that the patient is unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy secondary to significant orthostasis and the fact that the patient will not respond to oral titration at this point due to lack of cardiac reserve, the patient will need to be discharged home on Primacor.  The patient is unable to continue with his dobutamine therapy secondary to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  At this time, we will transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for titration of the Primacor therapy.  We will also increase his Lasix to 80 mg IV q.d.  We will increase his amiodarone to 400 mg daily.  We will also continue with his Coumadin therapy.  As stated previously, we will discontinue vasodilator therapy starting with the Isordil.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient presents today for followup, history of erectile dysfunction, last visit started on Cialis 10 mg.  He indicates that he has noticed some mild improvement of his symptoms, with no side effect.  On this dose, he is having firm erection, able to penetrate, lasting for about 10 or so minutes.  No chest pain, no nitroglycerin usage, no fever, no chills.  No dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills.  Daytime frequency every three hours, nocturia times 0, good stream.  He does have a history of elevated PSA and biopsy June of this year was noted for high grade PIN, mid left biopsy, with two specimens being too small to evaluate.  PSA 11.6.  Dr. X's notes are reviewed.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Some improvement of erectile dysfunction, on low dose of Cialis, with no side effects.  The patient has multiple risk factors, but denies using any nitroglycerin or any cardiac issues at this time.  We reviewed options of increasing the medication, versus trying other medications, options of penile prosthesis, Caverject injection use as well as working pump is reviewed.,2.  Elevated PSA in a patient with a recent biopsy showing high-grade PIN, as well as two specimens not being large enough to evaluate.  The patient tells me he has met with his primary care physician and after discussion, he is in consideration of repeating a prostate ultrasound and biopsy.  However, he would like to meet with Dr. X to discuss these prior to biopsy.,PLAN: , Following detailed discussion, the patient wishes to proceed with Cialis 20 mg, samples are provided as well as Levitra 10 mg, may increase this to 20 mg and understand administration of each and contraindication as well as potential side effects are reviewed.  The patient not to use them at the same time.  Will call if any other concern.  In the meantime, he is scheduled to meet with Dr. X, with a prior PSA in consideration of a possible repeating prostate ultrasound and biopsy.  He declined scheduling this at this time.  All questions answered.

PROCEDURE: , Circumcision.,Signed informed consent was obtained and the procedure explained.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: ,The child was placed in a Circumstraint board and restrained in the usual fashion.  The area of the penis and scrotum were prepared with povidone iodine solution.  The area was draped with sterile drapes, and the remainder of the procedure was done with sterile procedure.  A dorsal penile block was done using 2 injections of 0.3 cc each, 1% plain lidocaine.  A dorsal slit was made, and the prepuce was dissected away from the glans penis.  A Gomco clamp was properly placed for 5 minutes.  During this time, the foreskin was sharply excised using a #10 blade.  With removal of the clamp, there was a good cosmetic outcome and no bleeding.  The child appeared to tolerate the procedure well.  Care instructions were given to the parents.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Bilateral bronchopneumonia.,2.  Empyema of the chest, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Bilateral bronchopneumonia.,2.  Empyema of the chest, left.,PROCEDURES,1.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy.,2.  Limited left thoracotomy with partial pulmonary decortication and insertion of chest tubes x2.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Initially, the patient was intubated with a #6 French tube because of the presence of previous laryngectomy.  Because of this, I proceeded to use a pediatric bronchoscope, which provided limited visualization, but I was able to see the trachea and the carina and both left and right bronchial systems without significant pathology, although there was some mucus secretion that was aspirated.,Then, with the patient properly anesthetized and looking very stable, we decided to insert a larger endotracheal tube that allowed for the insertion of the regular adult bronchoscope.  Therefore, we were able to obtain a better visualization and see the trachea and the carina that were normal and also the left and right bronchial systems.  Some brownish secretions were obtained, particularly from the right side and were sent for culture and sensitivity, both aerobic and anaerobic fungi and acid fast.,Then, the patient was turned with left side up and prepped for a left thoracotomy.  He was properly draped.  I had recently re-inspected the CT of the chest and decided to make a limited thoracotomy of about 6 cm or so in the midaxillary line about the sixth intercostal space.  Immediately, it was evident that there was a large amount of pus in the left chest.  We proceeded to insert the suction catheters and we rapidly obtained about 1400 mL of frank pus.  Then, we proceeded to open the intercostal space a bit more with a Richardson retractor and it was immediately obvious that there was an abundant amount of solid exudate throughout the lung.  We spent several minutes trying to clean up this area.  Initially, I had planned only to drain the empyema because the patient was in a very poor condition, but at this particular moment, he was more stable and well oxygenated, and the situation was such that we were able to perform a partial pulmonary decortication where we broke up a number of loculations that were present and we were able to separate the lung from the diaphragm and also the pulmonary fissure.  On the upper part of the chest, we had limited access, but overall we obtained a large amount of solid exudate and we were able to break out loculations.  We followed by irrigation with 2000 cc of warm normal saline and then insertion of two #32 chest tubes, which are the largest one available in this institution; one we put over the diaphragm and the other one going up and down towards the apex.,The limited thoracotomy was closed with heavy intercostal sutures of Vicryl, then interrupted sutures of #0 Vicryl to the muscle layers, and I loosely approximately the skin with a few sutures of nylon because I am suspicious that the incision may become infected because he has been exposed to intrapleural pus.,The chest tubes were secured with sutures and then connected to Pleur-evac.  Then, the patient was transported.,Estimated blood loss was minimal and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was extubated in the operating room and he was transferred to the ICU to be admitted.  A chest x-ray was ordered stat.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , In short, the patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with long-standing morbid obesity, resistant to nonsurgical methods of weight loss with BMI of 69.7 with comorbidities of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, possible sleep apnea, and also osteoarthritis of the lower extremities.  He is also an ex-smoker.  He is currently smoking and he is planning to quit and at least he should do this six to eight days before for multiple reasons including decreasing the DVT, PE rates and marginal ulcer problems after surgery, which will be discussed later on. ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On physical examination today, he weighs 514.8 pounds, he has gained 21 pounds since the last visit with us.  His pulse is 78, temperature is 97.5, blood pressure is 132/74.  Lungs are clear.  He is a pleasant gentleman with stigmata of supermorbid obesity expected of his size.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  No incisions.  No umbilical hernia, no groin hernia, has a large abdominal pannus.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Lower extremities; no pedal edema.  No calf tenderness.  Deep tendon reflexes are normal.  Lungs are clear.  S1, S2 is heard.  Regular rate and rhythm. ,DISCUSSION:,  I had a long talk with the patient about laparoscopic gastric bypass possible open including risks, benefits, alternatives, need for long-term followup, need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines.  I also explained to him complications including rare cases of death secondary to DVT, PE, leak, peritonitis, sepsis shock, multisystem organ failure, need for reoperations, need for endoscopy for bleeding or leak, operations which could be diagnostic laparoscopy, exploratory laparotomy, drainage procedure, gastrostomy, jejunostomy for feeding, bleeding requiring blood transfusion, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, rarely tracheostomy, rare cases of renal failure requiring dialysis, etc., were all discussed. ,All these are going to be at high risk for this patient secondary to his supermorbid obese condition. ,I also explained to him specific gastric bypass related complications including gastrojejunal stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation, marginal ulcer secondary to smoking or antiinflammatory drug intake, which can progress on to perforation or bleeding, small bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia or adhesions, signs and symptoms of which are described, so the patient could alert us for earlier intervention, symptomatic gallstone formation during rapid weight loss, how to avoid it by taking ursodiol, which will be prescribed in the postoperative period. ,Long-term complication of gastric bypass including hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, weight plateauing, psychosocial and marital issues, addiction transfer, etc., were all discussed with the patient.  The patient is at higher risk than usual set of patients secondary to his supermorbid obesity of BMI nearing 70 and also major cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  Smoking of course does not help and increase the risk for cardiopulmonary complications and is at increased risk for cardiac risk.  He will be seen by cardiologist, pulmonologist.  He will also undergo long Medifast dieting under our guidance, which is a very low-calorie diet to decrease the size of the liver and also to optimize his cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  He will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist in preparation for surgery for a multidisciplinary approach for short and long-term success. ,Especially for him in view of his restricted mobility, supermorbid obesity status, and possibility of a pulmonary hypertension secondary to sleep apnea, he has been advised to have retrievable IVC filter and also will go home on Lovenox.  He also needs to start exercising to increase his flexibility and muscle tone before surgery and also to start getting the habit of doing so.  All these were discussed with the patient.  The patient understands.  He wants to go to surgery.  All questions were answered.  I will see him in few weeks before the planned date of surgery.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation of the prostate.,FINDINGS:  ,After measurement of the prostate, we decided to place 5 rows of needles--row #1 had 3 needles, row #2 at the level of the mid-prostate had 4 needles, row #3 had 2 needles in the right lateral peripheral zone, row #4 was a single needle directly the urethra, and in row #5 were 2 needles placed in the left lateral peripheral zone.  Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure.  After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder.  Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum.  An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured.  Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement.  Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate.  Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra.  Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed.  The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted.  After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior.  The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself.  Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature.  The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Dental caries.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Dental caries.,PROCEDURE: , Dental restoration.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,This 2-year, 10-month-old male has not had any prior dental treatment because of his unmanageable behavior in a routine dental office setting.  He was referred to me for that reason to be treated under general anesthesia for his dental work.  Cavities have been noted by his parents and pediatrician that have been noted to be pretty severe.  There are no contraindications to this procedure.  He is healthy.  His history and physical is in the chart.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room at 10:15 and placed in the supine position.  Dr. X administered the general anesthetic after which 2 bite-wing and 2 periapical x-rays were exposed and developed and his teeth were examined.  A throat pack was then placed.  Tooth D had caries on the distal surface which was excavated and the tooth was restored with composite.  Teeth E and F had caries in the mesial and distal surfaces, these carious lesions were excavated and the teeth were restored with composite.  Tooth G had caries in the mesial surface which was excavated and the tooth was restored with composite.  Teeth I and L both had caries on the occlusal surfaces which were excavated and upon excavation of the caries in tooth I the pulp was perforated and a therapeutic pulpotomy was therefore necessary.  This was done using ferric sulfate and zinc oxide eugenol.  For final restorations, amalgam restorations were placed involving the occlusal surfaces both teeth I and L. A prophylaxis was done and topical fluoride applied and the excess was suctioned thoroughly.  The throat pack was removed and the patient was awakened and brought to the recovery room in good condition at 11:30.  There was no blood loss.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, partially due to medications, at least when I first saw him in the office on 01/11/06. He is now 77 years old. He is being seen on the Seventh Floor. The patient is in Room 7607. The patient has a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable, since it engulfed the porta hepatis. The workup began with GI bleeding. He was seen in my office on 01/11/06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. A nonocclusive DVT was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. Both legs were edematous, and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present. An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a Greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. Additional information on the echocardiogram, where a grossly dilated left atrium, moderately severely dilated right atrium. The rhythm was, as stated before, atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. There was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic insufficiency. The ejection fraction was considered low normal, since it was estimated 50 to 54%. The patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia. The leg edema improved while lying down, suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. The patient, who was diabetic, received consultation by Dr. R. He was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ACE inhibitors. The atrial fibrillation was slow, and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time. As a matter of fact, they were discontinued. Now, the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization, and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia.,ALLERGIES:, THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,His diabetes was suspected to be complicated with neuropathy due to tingling in both feet. He received his immunizations with flu in 2005 but did not receive Pneumovax.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient is married. He had 1 child who died at the age of 26 months of unknown etiology. He quit smoking 6 years ago but dips (smokeless) tobacco.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Mother had cancer, died at 70. Father died of unknown cause, and brother died of unknown cause.,FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY:, The patient is wheelchair bound at the time of his initial hospitalization. He is currently walking in the corridor with assistance. Nocturia twice to 3 times per night.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,OPHTHALMOLOGIC: Uses glasses.,ENT: Complains of occasional sinusitis.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Hypertension and atrial fibrillation.,RESPIRATORY: Normal.,GI: Colon bleeding. The patient believes he had ulcers.,GENITOURINARY: Normal.,MUSCULOSKELETAL: Complains of arthritis and gout.,INTEGUMENTARY: Edema of ankles and joints.,NEUROLOGICAL: Tingling as per above. Denies any psychiatric problems.,ENDOCRINE: Diabetes, NIDDM.,HEMATOLOGIC AND LYMPHATIC: The patient does not use any aspirin or anticoagulants and is not of anemia.,LABORATORY:, Current EKG demonstrates atrial fibrillation with incomplete left bundle branch block pattern. Q waves are noticed in the inferior leads. Nonprogression of the R-wave from V1 to V4 with small R-waves in V5 and V6 are suggestive of an old anterior and inferior infarcts. Left ventilator hypertrophy and strain is suspected.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: On exam, the patient is alert, oriented and cooperative. He is mildly pale. He is an elderly gentleman who is currently without diaphoresis, pallor, jaundice, plethora, or icterus.,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 159/69 with a respiratory rate of 20, pulse is 67 and irregularly irregular. Pulse oximetry is 100.,NECK: Without JVD, bruit, or thyromegaly. The neck is supple.,CHEST: Symmetric. There is no heave or retraction.,HEART: The heart sounds are irregular and no significant murmurs could be auscultated.,LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.,ABDOMEN: Exam was deferred.,LEGS: Without edema. Pulses: Dorsalis pedis pulse was palpated bilaterally.,MEDICATIONS:, Current medications include enalapril, low dose enoxaparin, Fentanyl patches. He is no longer on fluconazole. He is on a sliding scale as per Dr. Holden. He is on lansoprazole (Prevacid), Toradol, piperacillin/tazobactam, hydralazine p.r.n., Zofran, Dilaudid, Benadryl, and Lopressor p.r.n.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:, The patient is a very pleasant elderly gentleman with intractable/inoperable malignancy. His cardiac issues are chronic and most likely secondary to long term hypertension and diabetes. He has chronic atrial fibrillation. I do not envision a scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control. He is also not a candidate for anticoagulation, which is, in essence, a part and parcel of the weight control. Reason being is high likelihood for GI bleeding, especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organs and lymph nodes. At this point, I agree with the notion of hospice care. If his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive, occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem or beta blockers would be appropriate; otherwise, I would keep him off those medications due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blockers.
CC:, Left hemibody numbness.,HX:, This 44y/o RHF awoke on 7/29/93 with left hemibody numbness without tingling, weakness, ataxia, visual or mental status change. She had no progression of her symptoms until 7/7/93 when she notices her right hand was stiff and clumsy. She coincidentally began listing to the right when walking. She denied any recent colds/flu-like illness or history of multiple sclerosis. She denied symptoms of Lhermitte's or Uhthoff's phenomena.,MEDS:, none.,PMH:, 1)Bronchitis twice in past year (last 2 months ago).,FHX:, Father with HTN and h/o strokes at ages 45 and 80; now 82 years old.

There was mildly increased muscle tone in the RUE and RLE.,Sensory: decreased PP below T2 level on left and some dysesthesias below L1 on the left.,Coord: positive rebound in RUE.,Station/Gait: unremarkable.,Reflexes: 3+/3 throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.,Rectal exam not done.,Gen exam reportedly "normal.",COURSE:, GS, CBC, PT, PTT, ESR, Serum SSA/SSB/dsDNA, B12 were all normal. MRI C-spine, 7/145/93, showed an area of decreased T1 and increased T2 signal at the C4-6 levels within the right lateral spinal cord. The lesion appeared intramedullary and eccentric, and peripherally enhanced with gadolinium. Lumbar puncture, 7/16/93, revealed the following CSF analysis results: RBC 0, WBC 1 (lymphocyte), Protein 28mg/dl, Glucose 62mg/dl, CSF Albumin 16 (normal 14-20), Serum Albumin 4520 (normal 3150-4500), CSF IgG 4.1mg/dl (normal 0-6.2), CSF IgG, % total CSF protein 15% (normal 1-14%), CSF IgG index 1.1 (normal 0-0.7), Oligoclonal bands were present. She was discharged home.,The patient claimed her symptoms resolved within one month. She did not return for a scheduled follow-up MRI C-spine.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 91-year-old female who was brought in by family.  Apparently, she was complaining that she felt she might have been poisoned at her care facility.  The daughter who accompanied the patient states that she does not think anything is actually wrong, but she became extremely agitated and she thinks that is the biggest problem with the patient right now.  The patient apparently had a little bit of dry heaves, but no actual vomiting.  She had just finished eating dinner.  No one else in the facility has been ill.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for previous abdominal surgeries.  She has a pacemaker.  She has a history of recent collarbone fracture.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Very difficult to get from the patient herself.  She seems to deny any significant pain or discomfort, but really seems not particularly intent on letting me know what is bothering her.  She initially stated that everything was wrong, but could not specify any specific complaints.  Denies chest pain, back pain, or abdominal pain.  Denies any extremity symptoms or complaints.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker.  She is accompanied here with daughter who brought her over here.  They were visiting the patient when this episode occurred.,MEDICATIONS:  Please see list.,ALLERGIES:  NONE.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile, actually has a very normal vital signs including normal pulse oximetry at 99% on room air.  GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly frail looking little lady lying on the gurney.  She is awake, alert, and not really wanted to answer most of the questions I asked her.  She does have a tremor with her mouth, which the daughter states has been there for "many years".  HEENT:  Eye exam is unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is still moist and well hydrated.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Actually clear with good breath sounds.  There are no wheezes, no rales, or rhonchi.  Good air movement.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  I do not elicit any tenderness.  There is no abdominal distention.  Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants.  SKIN:  Skin is without rash or petechiae.  There is no cyanosis.  EXTREMITIES:  No evidence of any trauma to the extremities.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  I had a long discussion with the family and they would like the patient receive something for agitation, so she was given 0.5 mg of Ativan intramuscularly.  After about half an hour, I came back to talk to the patient and the family, the patient states that she feels better.  Family states she seems more calm.  They do not want to pursue any further workup at this time.,IMPRESSION:  ACUTE EPISODE OF AGITATION.,PLAN:  At this time, I had reviewed the patient's records and it is not particularly enlightening as to what could have triggered off this episode.  The patient herself has good vital signs.  She does not seem to have any specific acute process going on and seemed to feel comfortable after the Ativan was given, a small quantity was given to the patient.  Family and daughter specifically did not want to pursue any workup at this point, which at this point I think is reasonable and we will have her follow up with ABC.  She is discharged in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS,1.  Aortoiliac occlusive disease bilaterally.,2.  Dementia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS,1.  Aortoiliac occlusive disease bilaterally.,2.  Dementia.,OPERATION: , Aortobifemoral bypass surgery utilizing a bifurcated Hemashield graft.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 300 cc,INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: , 1200 cc of crystalloid,URINE OUTPUT: , 250 cc,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  We closed the peritoneum over the graft with 4-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The abdomen was closed with #1 nylon in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at end of case.  Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Brain tumor left temporal lobe.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Brain tumor left temporal lobe - glioblastoma multiforme.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,1.  Left temporal craniotomy.,2.  Removal of brain tumor.,OPERATING MICROSCOPE: , Stealth.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side.  The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation.  Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull.  A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome.  The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.,The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion.  Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle.  We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this.  We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface.  Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance.  We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid.  This was submitted to pathology.  We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology.  They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor.  It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed.  We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially.  We could see it through the ventricle.  After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal.  The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system.  The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used for skin closure.  The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc.  There were no complications of the surgery per se.  The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct.,COMMENT:  ,Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain.

He is hemodynamically stable on heparin and Integrilin bolus and infusion was initiated.  The right femoral area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 2 mL was then filled locally.  The right femoral artery was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by a 6-French vascular sheath.  A guiding catheter XB 3.5 was advanced in manipulated to cannulate the left coronary artery and angiography was obtained.  A confirmed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery with minimal collaterals and also occlusion of the right coronary artery, which is well collateralized.  An angioplasty wire with present wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery, and could cross the area of occlusion within the stent.  An angioplasty balloon measuring 2.0 x 15 was advanced and three inflations were obtained.  It successfully re-canalized the artery.  There is evidence of residual stenosis within the distal aspect of the previous stents.  A drug-eluting stent Xience 2.75 x 15 was advanced and positioned within the area of stenosis with its distal marker adjacent to bifurcation with a diagonal branch and was deployed at 12 and 18 atmospheres.  The intermittent result was improved.  An additional inflation was obtained more proximally.  His blood pressure fluctuated and dropped in the 70s, correlating with additional sedation.  There is patency of the left anterior descending artery and good antegrade flow.  The guiding catheter was replaced with a 5-French Judkins right catheter manipulated to cannulate the right coronary artery and selective angiography was obtained.  The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle and pressure measurement was obtained including pullback across the aortic valve.  The right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18-guage needle followed by an 8-French vascular sheath.  A 8-French Swan-Ganz catheter was then advanced under fluoroscopic and hemodynamic control and pressure stenting was obtained from the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge position.  Cardiac catheter was determined by thermal dilution.  The procedure was then concluded, well tolerated and without complications.

REASON FOR ADMISSION:,  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.,HISTORY: , A very pleasant 63-year-old hypertensive, nondiabetic, African-American female with a history of peritoneal mesothelioma.  The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.  No suspicious osseous lesions were noted.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Norco 10 per 325 one to two p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily, Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea, lorazepam 0.5 mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety, Ventolin HFA 2 puffs q.6h. p.r.n., Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, Cymbalta 60 mg p.o. daily, and Restoril 30 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.,ALLERGIES: , THE PATIENT STATES THAT ON OCCASION LORAZEPAM DOSE PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS, AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY TOLERATING ATIVAN.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's height is 165 cm, weight is 77 kg.

Hematocrit is 33.8, but the indices are normochromic and normocytic.  BMP is remarkable for a random glucose of 147.  All other values are unremarkable.  LFTs are normal.  Serum alcohol is less than 5.,TREATMENT: , Patient was given 2 L of normal saline wide open as well as Compazine 5 mg IV x2 doses with resolution of her nausea.  She was given two capsules of Imodium with some apple juice, which she was able to keep down.  The patient did feel well enough to be discharged home.,ASSESSMENT:,  Viral gastroenteritis.,PLAN: , Rx for Compazine 10 mg tabs, dispense five, sig. one p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. for any recurrent nausea.  She was urged to use liquids only until the nausea has gone for 12 to 24 hours with slow advancement of her diet.  Imodium for any diarrhea, but no dairy products until the diarrhea has gone for at least 24 hours.  If she is unimproved in the next two days, she was urged to follow up with her PCP back home.
OPERATION PERFORMED:, Phacoemulsification of cataract and posterior chamber lens implant, right eye., ,ANESTHESIA:, Retrobulbar nerve block, right eye, ,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where local anesthetic was administered to the right eye followed by a dilute drop of Betadine and a Honan balloon.  Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.  The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag.  The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A.  Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision.  The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera.  The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Maxitrol ointment was applied topically followed by an eye pad and shield.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was taken from the operating room in good condition.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Right hydronephrosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 56-year-old female who has a history of uterine cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma.  She is scheduled to undergo mastectomy in two weeks.  In September 1999, she was diagnosed with right breast cancer and underwent lumpectomy and axillary node dissection and radiation.  Again, she is scheduled for mastectomy in two weeks.  She underwent a recent PET scan for Dr. X, which revealed marked hydronephrosis on the right possibly related to right UPJ obstruction and there is probably a small nonobstructing stone in the upper pole of the right kidney.  There was no dilation of the right ureter noted.  Urinalysis today is microscopically negative.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Uterine cancer, mesothelioma, breast cancer, diabetes, hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Lumpectomy, hysterectomy.,MEDICATIONS:,  Diovan HCT 80/12.5 mg daily, metformin 500 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  None.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is retired.  Does not smoke or drink.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  I have reviewed his review of systems sheet and it is on the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  Please see the physical exam sheet I completed.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, no palpable masses, no CVA tenderness.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Marked right hydronephrosis without hydruria.  She believes she had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis at Hospital in 2005.  I will try to obtain the report to see if the right kidney was evaluated at that time.  She will need evaluation with an IVP and renal scan to determine the point of obstruction and renal function of the right kidney.  She is quite anxious about her upcoming surgery and would like to delay any evaluation of this until the surgery is completed.  She will call us back to schedule the x-rays.  She understands the great importance and getting back in touch with us to schedule these x-rays due to the possibility that it may be somehow related to the cancer.  There is also a question of a stone present in the kidney.  She voiced a complete understanding of that and will call us after she recovers from her surgery to schedule these tests.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  End-stage renal disease.,2.  Left subclavian vein occlusion.,3.  Status post chronic tracheostomy.,4.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting.,5.  Right subclavian vein stenosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  End-stage renal disease.,2.  Left subclavian vein occlusion.,3.  Status post chronic tracheostomy.,4.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting.,5.  Right subclavian vein stenosis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE,Creation of autologous right brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula - first stage.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE,This patient has a known left subclavian vein occlusion.  The right subclavian vein has an estimated 50% stenosis.  The patient has a catheter traversed in the right innominate vein.  The right basilic vein was judged to be suitable for usage on vein mapping.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS,The basilic vein was of an adequate size, but somewhat sclerotic.  A first stage autologous right brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula was created.  A grade 2 was felt at completion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The patient received regional nerve block.  The patient also received intravenous sedation.  The right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  We used ultrasound to locate the basilic vein at the cubital fossa.,A small transverse incision was made slightly above the basilic vein.  The basilic vein was identified and immobilized.  The basilic vein was of a good size, but somewhat sclerotic.  The underlying fascia was incised and the brachial artery was identified and immobilized.  The brachial artery was normal.  We then divided the basilic vein distally.  The distal end was ligated using silk suture.  The brachial artery was clamped proximally and distally.  A small longitudinal arteriotomy was made in the brachial artery.  We did not give heparin.  The end of the basilic vein was then sewn end-to-side to the brachial artery using a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  ,Just prior to completion of the anastomosis, it was flushed and anastomosis was completed.  Flow was then established.  A grade 2 was felt in the outflow basilic fistula.  Hemostasis was secured.  The wound was then closed in layers using interrupted PDS sutures for the fascia and a running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture for the skin.  A sterile dry dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no operative complications.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right inguinal hernia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right inguinal hernia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE:  ,Right inguinal hernia repair.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a right inguinal bulge, which comes and goes with Valsalva standing and some increased physical activity.  He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.  The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Appendicitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Appendicitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic appendectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented with right lower quadrant pain.  She was evaluated and found to have a CT evidence of appendicitis.  She was subsequently consented for a laparoscopic appendectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the table.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in usual sterile fashion.  After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, supraumbilical incision was made.  A Veress needle was inserted.  Abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  A 5-mm port and camera placed.  The abdomen was visually explored.  There were no obvious abnormalities.  A 15-mm port was placed in the suprapubic position in addition of 5 mm was placed in between the 1st two.  Blunt dissection was used to isolate the appendix.  Appendix was separated from surrounding structures.  A window was created between the appendix and the mesoappendix.  GIA stapler was tossed across it and fired.  Mesoappendix was then taken with 2 fires of the vascular load on the GIA stapler.  Appendix was placed in an Endobag and removed from the patient.  Right lower quadrant was copiously irrigated.  All irrigation fluids were removed.  Hemostasis was verified.  The 15-mm port was removed and the port site closed with 0-Vicryl in the Endoclose device.  All other ports were irrigated, infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Overall, the patient tolerated this well, was awakened and returned to recovery in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Basal cell carcinoma (0.8 cm diameter), right medial canthus.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Basal cell carcinoma (0.8 cm diameter), right medial canthus.,OPERATION: , Excision basal cell carcinoma (0.8 cm diameter), right medial canthus with frozen section, and reconstruction of defect (1.2 cm diameter) with glabellar rotation flap.,ANESTHESIA:,  Monitored anesthesia care.,JUSTIFICATION: , The patient is an 80-year-old white female with a biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma of the right medial canthus.  She was scheduled for elective excision with frozen section under local anesthesia as an outpatient.,PROCEDURE: , With an intravenous infusing and under suitable premedication, the patient was placed supine on the operative table.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex draped.  The right medial canthal region and the glabellar region were anesthetized with 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,Under loupe magnification, the lesion was excised with 2 mm margins, oriented with sutures and submitted for frozen section pathology.  The report was "basal cell carcinoma with all margins free of tumor."  Hemostasis was controlled with the Bovie.  Excised lesion diameter was 1.2 cm.  The defect was closed by elevating a left laterally based rotation flap utilizing the glabellar skin.  The flap was elevated with a scalpel and Bovie, rotated into the defect without tension, ***** to the defect with scissors and inset in layer with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl for the dermis and running 5-0 Prolene for the skin.  Donor site was closed in V-Y fashion with similar suture technique.,The wounds were dressed with bacitracin ointment.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She tolerated the procedure satisfactorily, and then no complications.  Blood loss was essentially nil.
PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Basal Cell CA.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Basal Cell CA.,LOCATION: , Mid parietal scalp.,PREOP SIZE:,  1.5 x 2.9 cm,POSTOP SIZE:,  2.7 x 2.9 cm,INDICATION:,  Poorly defined borders.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,HEMOSTASIS:, Electrodessication.,PLANNED RECONSTRUCTION:,  Simple Linear Closure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  Prior to each surgical stage, the surgical site was tested for anesthesia and reanesthetized as needed, after which it was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.,The clinically-apparent tumor was carefully defined and debulked prior to the first stage, determining the extent of the surgical excision.  With each stage, a thin layer of tumor-laden tissue was excised with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin, using the Mohs fresh tissue technique.  A map was prepared to correspond to the area of skin from which it was excised.  The tissue was prepared for the cryostat and sectioned.  Each section was coded, cut and stained for microscopic examination.  The entire base and margins of the excised piece of tissue were examined by the surgeon.  Areas noted to be positive on the previous stage (if applicable) were removed with the Mohs technique and processed for analysis.,No tumor was identified after the final stage of microscopically controlled surgery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complication.  After discussion with the patient regarding the various options, the best closure option for each defect was selected for optimal functional and cosmetic results.

Cystoscopy showed a few cellules of the bladder with no obvious bladder tumors noted.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to operating room and spinal anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and a #21 French cystoscope inserted into urethra and into the bladder.  Cystoscopy performed with the above findings.  Cystoscope was removed.  A #27 French resectoscope with a #26 cutting loop was inserted into the bladder.  Verumontanum was identified as a landmark and systematic transurethral resection of the prostate tissue was undertaken in an circumferential fashion with good resection of tissue completed.  ________ irrigator was used to evacuate the bladder of prostatic chips.  Resectoscope was then inserted and any residual chips were removed in piecemeal fashion with a resectoscope loop.  Any obvious bleeding from the prostatic fossa was controlled with electrocautery.  Resectoscope was removed.  A #24 French three-way Foley catheter inserted into the urethra and into the bladder.  Bladder was irrigated and connected to three-way irrigation.  The patient was cleaned and sent to recovery in stable condition to be admitted overnight for continuous bladder irrigation and postop monitoring.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Cervical spondylosis C5-C6 greater than C6-C7 (721.0).,2.  Neck pain, progressive (723.1) with right greater than left radiculopathy (723.4).,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Cervical spondylosis C5-C6 greater than C6-C7 (721.0).,2.  Neck pain, progressive (723.1) with right greater than left radiculopathy (723.4), surgical findings confirmed.,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and C6-C7 for neural decompression (63075, 63076).,2.  Anterior interbody fusion at C5-C6 and C6-C7 (22554, 22585) utilizing Bengal cages x2 (22851).,3.  Anterior instrumentation by Uniplate construction C5, C6, and C7 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,OPERATIONS: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position where general anesthesia was administered.  Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues.  Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7.  Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen.  This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well.  This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed.  At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam.  Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7.  These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size.  The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc.  The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.,Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition.  At the conclusion of the case, all instrument, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct.  There were no intraoperative complications of any type.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Cataract, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cataract, right eye.,TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens insertion, right eye.,ANESTHESIA: , Retrobulbar block.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where retrobulbar anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped using standard procedure.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to keep the eye open and the eye rotated downward with a 0.12.  The anterior chamber was entered by making a small superior limbal incision with a crescent blade and then entering the anterior chamber with a keratome.  The chamber was then filled with viscoelastic and a continuous-tear capsulorrhexis performed.  The phacoemulsification was then instilled in the eye and a linear incision made in the lens.  The lens was then cracked with a McPherson forceps, and the remaining lens material removed with the phacoemulsification tip.  The remaining cortex was removed with an I&A.  The capsular bag was then inflated with viscoelastic and the wound extended slightly with the keratome.  The folding posterior chamber lens was then inserted in the capsular bag and rotated into position.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed from the eye with the I&A.  The wound was checked for watertightness and found to be watertight.  Tobramycin drops were instilled in the eye and a shield placed over it.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

She has been on the medical floor for monitoring and is medically stable and was transferred to the psychiatric floor today.  The patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks.  Felt that her Huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble.  Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression.  Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient's Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth.  They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression.  The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday.  She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened.  Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping.  About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital.,She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mr. ABC is a 60-year-old gentleman who had a markedly abnormal stress test earlier today in my office with severe chest pain after 5 minutes of exercise on the standard Bruce with horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on stress imaging only.  He required 3 sublingual nitroglycerin in total (please see also admission history and physical for full details).,The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with myself today which showed mild-to-moderate left main distal disease of 30%, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion of 99%, and a mid-left circumflex lesion of 80% with normal LV function and some mild luminal irregularities in the right coronary artery with some moderate stenosis seen in the mid to distal right PDA.,I discussed these results with the patient, and he had been relating to me that he was having rest anginal symptoms, as well as nocturnal anginal symptoms, and especially given the severity of the mid left anterior descending lesion, with a markedly abnormal stress test, I felt he was best suited for transfer for PCI.  I discussed the case with Dr. X at Medical Center who has kindly accepted the patient in transfer.,CONDITION ON TRANSFER: , Stable but guarded.  The patient is pain-free at this time.,MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:,1.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,2.

Intractable nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia.,3.  Enterogastritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , EGD with PEG tube placement using Russell technique.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with 1% lidocaine for local.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,None.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 44-year-old African-American female who is well known to this service.  She has been hospitalized multiple times for intractable nausea and vomiting and dehydration.  She states that her decreased p.o. intake has been progressively worsening.  She was admitted to the service of Dr. Lang and was evaluated by Dr. Wickless as well all of whom agreed that the best option for supplemental nutrition for this patient was placement of a PEG tube.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, complications, and benefits were explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  She was placed in the supine position.  The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.  The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty.  There was no gross evidence of any malignancy.  There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam.  The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach.  This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine.  Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization.  A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed.  A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well.  A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach.  The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away.  Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope.  The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture.  Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition.  She was subsequently returned to her room on the General Medical Floor.  Previous orders will be resumed.  We will instruct the Nursing that the PEG tube can be used at 5 p.m. this evening for medications if necessary and bolus feedings.
TITLE OF OPERATION:,1.  Removal of painful hardware, first left metatarsal.,2.  Excision of nonunion, first left metatarsal.,3.  Incorporation of corticocancellous bone graft with internal fixation consisting of screws and plates of the first left metatarsal.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nonunion of fractured first left metatarsal osteotomy.,2.  Painful hardware, first left metatarsal.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nonunion of fractured first left metatarsal osteotomy.,2.  Painful hardware, first left metatarsal.,ANESTHESIA:,  General anesthesia with local infiltration of 5 mL of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain with 1:100,000 epinephrine preoperatively and 15 mL of 0.5% Marcaine postoperatively.,HEMOSTASIS: , Left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg for 60 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 mL.,MATERIALS USED:,  2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Prolene, as well as one corticocancellous allograft consisting of ASIS and one T-type plate prebent with six screw holes and five 3.0 partially threaded cannulated screws and a single 3.0 noncannulated screw from the OsteoMed and Synthes System respectively for the fixation of the bone graft and the plate on the first left metatarsal.,INJECTABLES: , 1 g Ancef IV 30 minutes preoperatively and the afore-mentioned lidocaine.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After general anesthesia was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision was placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissues were mobilized from their attachments on the first left metatarsal shaft.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screws were identified and removed intact.  The screws were sent to pathology for examination.  The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding.  The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy.  Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished.  The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft.  Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent.  The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material.  All the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl suture material and 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges at this time.  The left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.,The patient was then transferred to the postanesthesia care unit with his vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given specific instructions and education on how to continue caring for his left foot surgery.  The patient was also given pain medications, instructions on how to control his postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for his first postoperative appointment.

The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.  He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system.  Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department.  He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side.  MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.  There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.  I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies any previous past medical history.  He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is uninsured.,MEDICATIONS:,  He does not take any medications.,ALLERGIES: , He has no known drug allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with his wife.  He was an IT software developer, but he has been out of work for several months.  He smokes less than a pack of cigarettes daily.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His mother died of a stroke in her 90s.  His father had colon cancer.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  BP 124/76
CC:, Confusion and slurred speech.,HX , (primarily obtained from boyfriend): This 31 y/o RHF experienced a "flu-like illness 6-8 weeks prior to presentation. 3-4 weeks prior to presentation, she was found "passed out" in bed, and when awoken appeared confused, and lethargic. She apparently recovered within 24 hours. For two weeks prior to presentation she demonstrated emotional lability, uncharacteristic of her ( outbursts of anger and inappropriate laughter). She left a stove on.,She began slurring her speech 2 days prior to admission. On the day of presentation she developed right facial weakness and began stumbling to the right. She denied any associated headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, neck stiffness or visual change. There was no history of illicit drug/ETOH use or head trauma.,PMH:, Migraine Headache.,FHX: , Unremarkable.,SHX: ,Divorced. Lives with boyfriend. 3 children alive and well. Denied tobacco/illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH.,ROS:, Irregular menses.,EXAM: ,BP118/66.  HR83. RR 20. T36.8C.,MS: Alert and oriented to name only. Perseverative thought processes. Utilized only one or two word answers/phrases. Non-fluent. Rarely followed commands. Impaired writing of name.,CN: Flattened right nasolabial fold only.,Motor: Mild weakness in RUE manifested by pronator drift. Other extremities were full strength.,Sensory: withdrew to noxious stimulation in all 4 extremities.,Coordination: difficult to assess.,Station: Right pronator drift.,Gait: unremarkable.,Reflexes: 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, Plantars were flexor bilaterally.,General Exam: unremarkable.,INITIAL STUDIES:, CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG were all unremarkable. Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified).,COURSE: ,MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable.,She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications.,In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy. OB/GYN exam including cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scanning revealed stage IV squamous cell cancer of the cervix. She died 9/24/92 of cervical cancer.

Recommend followup to ensure resolution given its consolidated appearance.,2.Bilateral atelectasis versus fibrosis.
SUBJECTIVE:,  Mom brings the patient in today for possible ear infection.  He is complaining of left ear pain today.  He was treated on 04/14/2004, with amoxicillin for left otitis and Mom said he did seem to get better but just started complaining of the left ear pain today.  He has not had any fever but the congestion has continued to be very thick and purulent.  It has never really resolved.  He has a loose, productive-sounding cough but not consistently and not keeping him up at night.  No wheezing or shortness of breath.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has had some wheezing in the past but nothing recently.,FAMILY HISTORY: , All siblings are on antibiotics for ear infections and URIs.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  The patient is a 5-year-old male.  Alert and cooperative.  No acute distress.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,HEENT:  Ear canals clear.  TMs, bilaterally, have distorted light reflexes but no erythema.  Gray in color.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Adenoid hypertrophy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Adenoid hypertrophy.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Adenoidectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia.  The McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and the tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.  The nasopharynx was inspected with the laryngeal mirror.  Serial passages of the curettes were utilized to remove the nasopharyngeal tissue, following which the nasopharynx was packed with 2 cherry gauze sponges coated in a solution of 0.25% Neo-Synephrine and tannic acid powder.,Attention was then redirected to the oropharynx.  The McIvor was reopened, packs removed, and the bleeding was controlled with the suction Bovie unit.  The catheters were removed, and the nasal passages and oropharynx were suctioned free of debris.  The McIvor was then removed, and the procedure was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Prior history of polyps.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Small polyps, no evidence of residual or recurrent polyp in the cecum.,PREMEDICATIONS: , Versed 5 mg, Demerol 100 mg IV.,REPORTED PROCEDURE:,  The rectal chamber revealed no external lesions.  Prostate was normal in size and consistency.,The colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced under direct vision at all times until the tip of the scope was placed in the cecum.  The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the ileocecal valve.  Navigation was difficult because it seemed that the cecum took an upward turn at its final turn, but the examination was completed.,The cecum was extensively studied and no lesion was seen.  There was not even a scar representing the prior polyp.  I was able to see the area across from the ileocecal valve exactly where the polyp was two years ago, and I saw no lesion at all.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn.  In the mid transverse colon, was a small submucosal lesion, which appeared to be a lipoma.  It was freely mobile and very small with normal overlying mucosa.  There was a similar lesion in the descending colon.  Both of these appeared to be lipomatous, so no attempt was made to remove them.  There were diverticula present in the sigmoid colon.  In addition, there were two polyps in the sigmoid colon both of which were resected using electrocautery.  There was no bleeding.  The scope was then withdrawn.  The rectum was normal.  When the scope was retroflexed in the rectum, two very small polyps were noted just at the anorectal margin, and so these were obliterated using the electrocautery snare.  There was no specimen and there was no bleeding.  The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.,ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:,1.  Small polyps, sigmoid colon, resected them.,2.  Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.,3.  Small rectal polyps, obliterated them.,4.  Submucosal lesions, consistent with lipomata as described.,5.  No evidence of residual or recurrent neoplasm in the cecum.

REASON FOR EXAM:,1.  Angina.,2.  Coronary artery disease.,INTERPRETATION:  ,This is a technically acceptable study.,DIMENSIONS:  ,Anterior septal wall 1.2, posterior wall 1.2, left ventricular end diastolic 6.0, end systolic 4.7.  The left atrium is 3.9.,FINDINGS:  ,  Left atrium was mildly to moderately dilated.  No masses or thrombi were seen.  The left ventricle was mildly dilated with mainly global hypokinesis, more prominent in the inferior septum and inferoposterior wall.  The EF was moderately reduced with estimated EF of 40% with near normal thickening.  The right atrium was mildly dilated.  The right ventricle was normal in size.,Mitral valve showed to be structurally normal with no prolapse or vegetation.  There was mild mitral regurgitation on color flow interrogation.  The mitral inflow pattern was consistent with pseudonormalization or grade 2 diastolic dysfunction.  The aortic valve appeared to be structurally normal.  Normal peak velocity.  No significant AI.  Pulmonic valve showed mild PI.  Tricuspid valve showed mild tricuspid regurgitation.  Based on which, the right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be mildly elevated at 40 to 45 mmHg.  Anterior septum appeared to be intact.  No pericardial effusion was seen.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Mild biatrial enlargement.,2.  Normal thickening of the left ventricle with mildly dilated ventricle and EF of 40%.,3.  Mild mitral regurgitation.,4.  Diastolic dysfunction grade 2.,5.  Mild pulmonary hypertension.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left masticator space infection secondary to necrotic tooth #17.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left masticator space infection secondary to necrotic tooth #17.,SURGICAL PROCEDURE:,  Extraoral incision and drainage of facial space infection and extraction of necrotic tooth #17.,FLUIDS:  ,500 mL of crystalloid.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 60 mL.,SPECIMENS:,  Cultures and sensitivities, Aerobic and anaerobic were sent for micro studies.,DRAINS:,  One 0.25-inch Penrose placed in the medial aspect of the masticator space.,CONDITION: , Good, extubated, breathing spontaneously, to PACU.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old Caucasian male with a 2-week history of a toothache and 5-day history of increasing swelling of his left submandibular region, presents to Clinic, complaining of difficulty swallowing and breathing.  Oral surgery was consulted to evaluate the patient.,After evaluation of the facial CT with tracheal deviation and abscess in the left muscular space, it was determined that the patient needed to be taken urgently to the operating room under general anesthesia and have the abscess incision and drainage and removal of tooth #17.  Risks, benefits, alternatives, treatments were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was transported to operating room #4 at Clinic.  He was laid supine on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetics and maintained with oral endotracheal intubation and inhalation of anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral and maxillofacial surgery fashion.,The surgeon approached the operating room table in sterile fashion.  Approximately 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were injected into the left submandibular area in the area of the incision.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, an 18-gauge needle was introduced into the left masticator space and approximately 5 mL of pus was removed.  This was sent for aerobic and anaerobic micro.  Using a 15-blade, a 2-cm incision was made in the left submandibular region, then a hemostat was introduced in blunt dissection into the medial border of the mandible was performed.  The left masticator space was thoroughly explored as well as the left submandibular space and submental space.  Pus was drained from this site.  Copious amounts of sterile fluid were irrigated into the site.,Attention was then directed intraorally where a moistened Ray-Tec sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx to act as a throat pack.  Approximately 4 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were injected into the left inferior alveolar nerve block.  Using a 15-blade, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was developed around tooth #17.  The tooth was elevated and delivered, and the lingual area of tooth #17 was explored and more pus was expressed.  This pus was evacuated intraorally __________ suction.  The extraction site and the left masticator space were irrigated, and it was noted that the irrigation was communicating with extraoral incision in the neck.,A 0.25-inch Penrose drain was placed in the lingual aspect of the mandible extraorally through the neck and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  A tack stitch intraorally with 3-0 chromic suture was placed.  The throat pack was then removed.  An orogastric tube was placed and removed all other stomach contents and then removed.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.  The patient was extubated, breathing spontaneously, and transported to PACU in good condition.
PRE-OP DIAGNOSES:,  Low back pain - 724.2, Herniated disc - 722.10, Lumbosacral Facet, arthropathy - 724.4.,POST-OP DIAGNOSES: , Low back pain - 724.2, Herniated disc - 722.10, Lumbosacral Facet, arthropathy - 724.4.,INTERVAL HISTORY:,  Plans, risks and options were reviewed with the patient in detail.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  One-month followup.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is an 88-year-old Caucasian female.  She comes here today with a friend.  The patient has no complaints.  She states she has been feeling well.  Her knees are not hurting her at all anymore and she is not needing Bextra any longer.  I think the last steroid injection that she had with Dr. XYZ really did help.  The patient denies any shortness of breath or cough.  Has no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  No diarrhea or constipation.  She states her appetite is good.  She clears her plate at noon.  She has had no fevers, chills, or sweats.  The friend with her states she is doing very well.  Seems to eat excellently at noontime, despite this, the patient continues to lose weight.  When I asked her what she eats for breakfast and for supper, she states she really does not eat anything.  Her only meal that she eats at the nursing home is the noon meal and then I just do not think she is eating much the rest of the time.  She states she is really not hungry the rest of the time except at lunchtime.  She denies any fevers, chills, or sweats.  We did do some lab work at the last office visit and CBC was essentially normal.  Comprehensive metabolic was essentially normal as was of the BUN of 32 and creatinine of 1.3.  This is fairly stable for her.  Liver enzymes were normal.  TSH was normal.  Free albumin was normal at 23.  She is on different antidepressants and that may be causing some difficulties with unintentional weight loss.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently are Aricept 10 mg a day, Prevacid 30 mg a day, Lexapro 10 mg a day, Norvasc 2.5 mg a day, Milk of Magnesia 30 cc daily, and Amanda 10 mg b.i.d.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Reviewed from 05/10/2004 and unchanged other than the addition of paranoia, which is much improved on her current medications.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is widow.  She is a nonsmoker, nondrinker.  She lives at Kansas Christian Home independently, but actually does get a lot of help with medications, having a driver to bring her here, and going to the noon meal.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  As above in HPI.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,General:  This is a well-developed, pleasant Caucasian female, who appears thinner especially in her face.  States are clothes are fitting more loosely.,Vital Signs:  Weight:  123, down 5 pounds from last month and down 11 pounds from May 2004.  Blood pressure:  128/62.  Pulse:  60.  Respirations:  20.  Temperature:  96.8.,Neck:  Supple.  Carotids are silent.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft and nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  No organomegaly or masses are appreciated.,Extremities:  Free of edema.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Unintentional weight loss.  I think this is more a problem of just not getting in any calories though does not appear to be a medical problem go on, although her dementia may make it difficult for her to remember to eat, and with her antidepressant medication she is on, she just may not have much of an appetite to eat unless food is prepared for her.,2.  Depression, doing well.,3.  Paranoia, doing well.,4.  Dementia, stable.,5.  Osteoarthritis of the knees, pain is much improved.,PLAN:,1.  Continue on current medications.,2.  I did call and talk with doctor at hospital.  We discussed different options.  We have decided to have the patient eat the evening meal at the nursing home also and have her take a supplement drink such as Ensure at breakfast time.  Connie will weigh the patient once a week and I will go ahead and see the patient in one month.  We can see how she is doing at that time.  If she continues to lose weight despite eating better, then I think we will need to do further evaluation.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:,  Delivered pregnancy, cholestasis of pregnancy, fetal intolerance to labor, failure to progress.,PROCEDURE: , Included primary low transverse cesarean section.,SUMMARY: , This 32-year-old gravida 2 was induced for cholestasis of pregnancy at 38-1/2 weeks.  The patient underwent a 2-day induction.  On the second day, the patient continued to progress all the way to the point of 9.5 cm at which point, she failed to progress.  During the hour or two of evaluation at 9.5 cm, the patient was also noted to have some fetal tachycardia and an occasional late deceleration.  Secondary to these factors, the patient was brought to the operative suite for primary low transverse cesarean section, which she underwent without significant complication.  There was a slightly enlarged blood loss at approximately 1200 mL, and postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a very mild tachycardia coupled with 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit temperature right at delivery.  It was felt that this was a sign of very early chorioamnionitis and therapeutic antibiotics were given throughout her stay.  The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics with there never being a temperature above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  The maternal tachycardia resolved within a day.  The patient did well throughout the 3-day stay progressing to full diet, regular bowel movements, normal urination patterns.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells on Sunday when attended to by my partner secondary to a hematocrit of 20%.  It should be noted, however, that this was actually an expected result with the initial hematocrit of 32% preoperatively.  Therefore, there was anemia but not an unexplained anemia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: , Includes the stable vital signs, afebrile state.  An alert and oriented patient who is desirous at discharge.  Full range of motion, all extremities; fully ambulatory.  Pulse is regular and strong.  Lungs are clear and the abdomen is soft and nontender with minimal tympany and a nontender fundus.  The incision is beautiful and soft and nontender.  There is scant lochia and there is minimal edema.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , Include hematocrit of 27% and the last liver function tests was within normal limits 48 hours prior to discharge.,FOLLOWUP: , For the patient includes pelvic rest, regular diet.  Follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks.  Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. cramps, Tylenol No.  3 one p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, prenatal vitamin one p.o. daily, and topical triple antibiotic to incision b.i.d. to q.i.d.
