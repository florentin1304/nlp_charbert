PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. ,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,  Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. ,PROCEDURE: ,  Exploratory laparotomy and drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with control of leakage. ,COMPLICATIONS:,  None. ,ANESTHESIA: , General oroendotracheal intubation. ,PROCEDURE:  , After adequate general anesthesia was administered, the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,  Phenol neurolysis left musculocutaneous nerve and bilateral obturator nerves.  Botulinum toxin injection left pectoralis major, left wrist flexors, and bilateral knee extensors.,PROCEDURE CODES: , 64640 times three, 64614 times four, 95873 times four.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Spastic quadriparesis secondary to traumatic brain injury, 907.0.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Spastic quadriparesis secondary to traumatic brain injury, 907.0.,ANESTHESIA:,  MAC.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: , Informed consent was obtained from the patient's brother.  The patient was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol.  The patient was positioned lying supine.  Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine.  The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 7 mL was injected on the right side and 5 mL on the left side.  At all sites of phenol injections in this area injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.  The musculocutaneous nerve was identified in the left upper extremity above the brachial pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 5 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location.  Injections in this area were done at the site of maximum elbow flexion contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.,Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 150 units was injected in the knee extensors bilaterally, 100 units in the left pectoralis major, and 50 units in the left wrist flexors.  Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.

He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery.  The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits.  The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was constructed.  Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system.  The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford.  Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered.  Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices.  These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.,Treatment plan was then performed by me.  I outlined the tumor volume.  Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient.  This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator.  The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy.  The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm.  The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%.  The coverage isodose line was 79%.  The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55.  The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved.,On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was applied.  Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position.  The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home.,Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months.  The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed.,I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM.,Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note.

He says that he has been stung by wasps before and had similar reactions.  He just said that he wanted to catch it early before he has too bad of a severe reaction like he has had in the past.  He has had a lot of swelling, but no anaphylaxis-type reactions in the past; no shortness of breath or difficultly with his throat feeling like it is going to close up or anything like that in the past; no racing heart beat or anxiety feeling, just a lot of localized swelling where the sting occurs.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  His temperature is 98.4.  Respiratory rate is 18.  Weight is 250 pounds.,Extremities:  Examination of his right hand and forearm reveals that he has an apparent sting just around his wrist region on his right hand on the medial side as well as significant swelling in his hand and his right forearm; extending up to the elbow.  He says that it is really not painful or anything like that.  It is really not all that red and no signs of infection at this time.,ASSESSMENT:,  Wasp sting to the right wrist area.,PLAN:,1.  Solu-Medrol 125 mg IM X 1.,2.  Over-the-counter Benadryl, ice and elevation of that extremity.,3.  Follow up with Dr. XYZ if any further evaluation is needed.
HISTORY: , The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005.  She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved.  Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain.  She has been extensively worked up and treated for this.  MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal.  She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain.  In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated.  She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face.  By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg.  Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved.  However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg.  The face numbness has completely resolved.  Symptoms are mild.  She denies any previous similar episodes.  She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function.  There is no associated headache.,Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination.  Normal gait.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation.  She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot.  In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick.  She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: , Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.,NEEDLE EMG: , Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is normal.  There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy.  EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident.  This was normal.,Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year.  Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms.  Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Invasive carcinoma of left breast.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Invasive carcinoma of left breast.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Left modified radical mastectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 52-year-old female who recently underwent a left breast biopsy and was found to have invasive carcinoma of the left breast.  The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.  The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Severe tonsillitis, palatal cellulitis, and inability to swallow.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This patient started having sore throat approximately one week ago; however, yesterday it became much worse.  He was unable to swallow.  He complained to his parent.  He was taken to Med Care and did not get any better, and therefore presented this morning to ER, where seen and evaluated by Dr. X and concerned as whether he had an abscess either pharyngeal, palatal, or peritonsillar.  He was noted to have extreme tonsillitis with kissing tonsils, marked exudates especially right side and right palatal cellulitis.  A CT scan at ER did not show abscess.  He has not had airway compromise, but he has had difficulty swallowing.  He may have had a low-grade fever, but nothing marked at home.  His records from Hospital are reviewed as well as the pediatric notes by Dr. X. He did have some equivalent leukocytosis.  He had a negative monospot and negative strep screen.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient takes no medications, has had no illnesses or surgeries and he is generally in good health other than being significantly overweight.  He is a sophomore at High School.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Noncontributory to this illness.,SURGERIES: , None.,HABITS: , Nonsmoker, nondrinker.

Mildly itchy.  Mother has penicillin allergy.,Endocrine:  The patient denies any weight loss, weight gain, skin changes, fatigue, etc, essentially no symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism.,Physical Exam:,General:  This is a morbidly obese white male adolescent, in no acute disease, alert and oriented x 4.  Voice is normal.  He is handling his secretions.  There is no stridor.,Vital Signs:  See vital signs in nurses notes.,Ears:  TM and EACs are normal.  External, normal.,Nose:  Opening clear.  External nose is normal.,Mouth:  Has bilateral marked exudates, tonsillitis, right greater than left.  Uvula is midline.  Tonsils are touching.

No mucosal lesions other than as noted.,Neck:  No thyromegaly, masses, or adenopathy except for some small minimally enlarged high jugular nodes.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,Abdomen:  Obese.  Complete exam deferred.,Skin:  Visualized skin dry and intact, except for rash on his inner thighs and upper legs, which is red maculopapular and consistent with possible allergic reaction.,Neuro:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Eyes, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, full range.,IMPRESSION: , Marked exudative tonsillitis, non-strep, non-mono, probably mixed anaerobic infection.  No significant prior history of tonsillitis.  Possible rash to PENICILLIN.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I concur with IV clindamycin and IV Solu-Medrol as per Dr. X. I anticipate this patient may need several days of IV antibiotics and then be able to switch over to oral.  I do not insist that this patient will need surgical intervention since there is no evidence of abscess.  This one episode of severe tonsillitis does not mean the patient needs tonsillectomy, but if he continues to have significant tonsil problems after this he should be referred for ENT evaluation as an outpatient.  The patient's parents in the room had expressed good understanding, have a chance to ask questions.  At this time, I will see the patient back on an as needed basis.

TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then was taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation.

Cold cardioplegia arrest of the heart.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  , 300 cc.,INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS:  , 1200 cc of crystalloid.,URINE OUTPUT:  , 250 cc.,AORTIC CROSS-CLAMP TIME: , **,CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME TOTAL: , **,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Achilles tendon rupture, left lower extremity.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Achilles tendon rupture, left lower extremity.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Primary repair left Achilles tendon.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,40 minutes at 325 mmHg.,POSITION:,  Prone.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old African-American male who states that he was stepping off a hilo at work when he felt a sudden pop in the posterior aspect of his left leg.  The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care.,PROCEDURE:,  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff.  While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.,A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes.  After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.  At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.

Implant.,5.  Allograft.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,COURSE ON ADMISSION: , This is the case of a very pleasant 41-year-old Caucasian female who was seen in clinic as an initial consultation on 09/13/07 complaining of intense neck pain radiating to the right shoulder blade to top of the right shoulder in to the right upper extremity to the patient's hand.  The patient's symptoms have been persistent and had gotten worse with subjective weakness of the right upper extremity since its onset for several weeks now.  The patient has been treated with medications, which has been unrelenting.  The patient had imaging studies that showed evidence of cervical spondylosis with herniated disk and stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7.  The patient underwent liver surgery and postoperatively her main issue was that of some degree of on and off right shoulder pain and some operative site soreness, which was treated well with IV morphine.  The patient has resolution of the pain down the arm, but she does have some tingling of the right thumb and right index finger.  The patient apparently is doing well with slight dysphagia, we treated her with Decadron and we will send her home with Medrol.  The patient will have continued pain medication coverage with Darvocet and Flexeril.  The patient will follow up with me as scheduled.  Instructions have been given.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Respiratory failure improved.,2.  Hypotension resolved.,3.  Anemia of chronic disease stable.,4.  Anasarca improving.,5.  Protein malnourishment improving.,6.  End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.,LABORATORY DATA: , Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  Electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 26, glucose 79, BUN 56, and creatinine 1.4.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9.,PLAN:  ,Discharge this gentleman from Hospital and admit him to Garden Court SNF where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  Hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  He has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  The family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time.
OPERATION PERFORMED:  ,Dental prophylaxis under general anesthesia.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Impacted wisdom teeth.,2.  Moderate gingivitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Impacted wisdom teeth.,2.  Moderate gingivitis.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Minimal.,DURATION OF SURGERY:  ,One hour 17 minutes.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient was referred to me by Dr. X.  He contacted myself and stated that Angelica was going to have her wisdom teeth extracted in the setting of a hospital operating room at Hospital and he inquired if we could pair on the procedure and I could do her full mouth dental rehabilitation before the wisdom teeth were removed by him.  I agreed.  I saw her in my office and she was cooperative for full mouth set of radiographs in my office and a clinical examination.  This clinical and radiographic examination revealed no dental caries; however, she was in need of a good dental cleaning.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION:  ,The patient was brought to Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by her mother.  I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all their questions and concerns were addressed, they gave their informed consent to proceed with the treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  Once she was cleared by Anesthesia, she was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection.  An Angiocath was previously placed in preop.  The head and neck were draped in sterile towels, and the body was covered with lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative digital intraoral photographs were taken.  No digital radiographs were taken in the operating room, as I stated before I had a full set of digital radiographs taken in my office.  A prophylaxis was then performed using a Prophy cup and fluoridated Prophy paste after scaling and replaning was done.  She presented with moderate calculus on the buccal surfaces of her maxillary, first molars and lower molars.  She did not require any restorative dentistry.,Upon the conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction and visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.,At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS: , This patient presented in her permanent dentition.  Her teeth #1, 16, 17, and 32 were impacted and are going to be removed following my full mouth dental rehabilitation by Dr. Alexander.  Oral hygiene was fair.  There was generalized plaque and calculus throughout.  She did not have any caries, did not require any restorative dentistry.,CONCLUSION:,  Following my dental surgery, the patient continued to intubated and was prepped for oral surgery procedures by Dr. X and his associates.  There were no postop pain requirements.  I did not have any specific requirements for the patient or her mother and that will be handled by Dr. X and their instructions on soft foods, etc., and pain control will be managed by them.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute cholecystitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute cholecystitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Zero.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, and after obtaining adequate general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position.  The abdominal area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A small skin incision was made below the umbilicus.  It was carried down in the transverse direction on the side of her old incision.  It was carried down to the fascia.  An open pneumoperitoneum was created with Hasson technique.  Three additional ports were placed in the usual fashion.  The gallbladder was found to be acutely inflamed, distended, and with some necrotic areas.  It was carefully retracted from the isthmus, and the cystic structure was then carefully identified, dissected, and divided between double clips.  The gallbladder was then taken down from the gallbladder fossa with electrocautery.  There was some bleeding from the gallbladder fossa that was meticulously controlled with a Bovie.  The gallbladder was then finally removed via the umbilical port with some difficulty because of the size of the gallbladder and size of the stones.  The fascia had to be opened.  The gallbladder had to be opened, and the stones had to be extracted carefully.  When it was completed, I went back to the abdomen and achieved complete hemostasis.  The ports were then removed under direct vision with the scope.  The fascia of the umbilical wound was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl.  All the incisions were injected with 0.25% Marcaine, closed with 4-0 Monocryl, Steri-Strips, and sterile dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage.,2.  Possible tumor versus inflammatory/infectious lesion versus vascular lesion, pending final pathology and microbiology.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Emergency right side craniotomy for temporal lobe intracerebral hematoma evacuation and resection of temporal lobe lesion.,2.  Biopsy of dura.,3.  Microscopic dissection using intraoperative microscope.,SPECIMENS: , Temporal lobe lesion and dura as well as specimen for microbiology for culture.,DRAINS:,  Medium Hemovac drain.,FINDINGS: , Vascular hemorrhagic lesion including inflamed dura and edematous brain with significant mass effect, and intracerebral hematoma with a history of significant headache, probable seizures, nausea, and vomiting.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Per Anesthesia.,FLUIDS: , One unit of packed red blood cells given intraoperatively.,The patient was brought to the operating room emergently.  This is considered as a life threatening admission with a hemorrhage in the temporal lobe extending into the frontal lobe and with significant mass effect.,The patient apparently became hemiplegic suddenly today.  She also had an episode of incoherence and loss of consciousness as well as loss of bowel/urine.,She was brought to Emergency Room where a CT of the brain showed that she had significant hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe extending into the external capsule and across into the frontal lobe.  There is significant mass effect.  There is mixed density in the parenchyma of the temporal lobe.,She was originally scheduled for elective craniotomy for biopsy of the temporal lobe to find out why she was having spontaneous hemorrhages.  However, this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room, and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect, and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ICH as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team.  Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed.  The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder.  Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly.  The scalp was resected anteriorly.  The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery.  The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed.,The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety.  The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers.,The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery.,The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected.  It was quite full.  The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur.  The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur.,Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax.  The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy.  This was left in place.,The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure.  Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made.  Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope.  The underlying brain was quite edematous.,Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface.  Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered.  The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal.  It was quite vascular.  Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself.  Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip.  The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology.  Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured.,Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished.  No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure.  Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected.  It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain.  However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed.  DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura.  The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system.  Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space.  Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl.  The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  The scalp was then reapproximated using staples.  The head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion.,She was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed commands briskly.  The pupils are 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light.  I accompanied her and transported her to the ICU where I signed out to the ICU attending.
SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 6-year-old male who comes in rechecking his ADHD medicines.  We placed him on Adderall, first time he has been on a stimulant medication last month.  Mother said the next day, he had a wonderful improvement, and he has been doing very well with the medicine.  She has two concerns.  It seems like first thing in the morning after he takes the medicine and it seems like it takes a while for the medicine to kick in.  It wears off about 2 and they have problems in the evening with him.  He was initially having difficulty with his appetite but that seems to be coming back but it is more the problems early in the morning after he takes this medicine than in the afternoon when the thing wears off.  His teachers have seen a dramatic improvement and she did miss a dose this past weekend and said he was just horrible.  The patient even commented that he thought he needed his medication.,PAST HISTORY:,  Reviewed from appointment on 08/16/2004.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  He is on Adderall XR 10 mg once daily.,ALLERGIES: , To medicines are none.,FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Reviewed from appointment on 08/16/2004.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  He has been having problems as mentioned in the morning and later in the afternoon but he has been eating well, sleeping okay.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 46.5 pounds, which is down just a little bit from his appointment last month.  He was 49 pounds, but otherwise, fairly well controlled, not all that active in the exam room.  Physical exam itself was deferred today because he has otherwise been very healthy.,ASSESSMENT:,  At this point is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, doing fairly well with the Adderall.,PLAN:,  Discussed with mother two options.  Switch him to the Ritalin LA, which I think has better release of the medicine early in the morning or to increase his Adderall dose.  As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer.  So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mother is to watch his diet.  We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months.  But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.  Mother understands and will call if there are problems.  Approximately 25 minutes spent with patient, all in discussion.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, right iliac vein and inferior vena cava (IVC), status post balloon angioplasty, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient was transferred here the evening of 02/23/2007 from Hospital with a new diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on confirmation by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts that afternoon.  History related to this illness probably dates back to October of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual "lump" posteriorly.  The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased.  Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin.  However, both of these problems have continued.  He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  Despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at University of Denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).,The morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000.  CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.  These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The patient was transferred here after stopping of the continuous infusion heparin and receiving a dose of Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously for further diagnostic evaluation and management of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Breast assymetry, status post previous breast surgery.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Breast assymetry, status post previous breast surgery.,OPERATION: , Capsulotomy left breast, flat advancement V to Y left breast for correction lower pole defect.,ANESTHESIA:,  LMA.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 35-year-old female who presents status post multiple breast surgeries with resultant flatness of the lower pole of the left breast.  The nipple inframammary fold distance is approximately 1.5 cm shorter than the fuller right breast.  The patient has bilateral Mentor-Smooth round moderate projection jell-filled mammary prosthesis, 225 cc.,The patient was marked in the upright position for mobilization of lateral skin flaps and increase in the length of the nipple inframammary fold distance.  She was then brought to the operating room and after satisfactory LMA anesthesia had been induced, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manger.  The patient received a gram of Kefzol prior to beginning the procedure.  The previous inverted T-scar was excised down to the underlying capsule of the breast implant.  The breast was carefully dissected off of the underlying capsule.  Care being taken to preserve the vascular supply to the skin and breast flap.  When the anterior portion of the breast was dissected free of the underlying capsule, the posterior aspect of the capsule was then dissected off of the underlying pectoralis muscle.  A posterior incision was made on the backside of the capsule at the proximate middle portion of the capsule and then reflected inferiorly thereby creating a superior based capsular flap.  The lateral aspects of the capsule were then opened and the inferior edge of the capsule was then sutured to the underside of the inframammary flap with 2-0 Monocryl statures.  Care was taken to avoid as much exposure of the implant, as well as damage to the implant.  When the flap had been created and advanced, hemostasis was obtained and the area copiously irrigated with a solution of Bacitracin 50,000 units, Kefzol 1 g, gentamicin 80 mg, and 500 cc of saline.  The lateral skin both medially and laterally were then completely freed and the vertical incision of the inverted T was then extended the 2 cm and sutured with a trifurcation suture of 2-0 Biosyn.  This lengthened the vertical portion of the mastopexy scar to allow for descent of the implant and roundness of the inferior pole of the left breast.  The remainder of the inverted T was closed with interrupted sutures of 3 and 2-0 Biosyn and the skin was closed with continuous suture of 5-0 nylon.  Bacitracin and a standard breast dressing were applied.,The anesthesia was terminated and the patient was recovered in the operating room.  Sponge, instrument, needle count reported as corrected.  Estimated blood loss negligible.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Eyebrow ptosis.,2.  Dermatochalasia of upper and lower eyelids with tear trough deformity of the lower eyelid.,3.  Cervical facial aging with submental lipodystrophy.,OPERATION:,1.  Hairline biplanar temporal browlift.,2.  Quadrilateral blepharoplasty with lateral canthopexy with arcus marginalis release and fat transposition over inferior orbital rim to lower eyelid.,3.  Cervical facial rhytidectomy with purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.,ASSISTANT:  ,None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in a supine position and prepped with general endotracheal anesthesia.  Local infiltration anesthesia with 1% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in upper and lower eyelids.,Markings were made and fusiform ellipse of skin was resected from the upper eyelid.  The lower limb of the fusiform ellipse was at the superior palpebral fold.  A 9 mm of upper eyelid skin was resected at the widest portion of the lips, which extended from medial canthal area to the lateral orbital rim.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically and the skin was removed.  Incision was made through the pretarsal orbicularis with small amount of fat being removed from the medial and middle fat pocket.  An incision was made over the superior orbital rim.  Subperiosteal dissection was performed over the forehead.  The dissection proceeded medially.  The corrugator and procerus muscles were carefully dissected from the supratrochlear nerves on both right and left side and cauterized.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery in this fashion.  A 4-cm incision was made, and the forehead at the hairline, subcutaneous dissection was performed and extended over the frontalis muscle for approximately 4 cm.  A subperiosteal dissection was performed after the fibers of the frontalis muscle were separated and subperiosteal dissection from the forehead lead the subperiosteal dissection from the upper eyelid.  The incision was made in the lower lid just beneath the lashline.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed over the pretarsal and preseptal muscle.  Dissection was then proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim.  The arcus marginalis was released and the lower eyelid fat was teased over the inferior orbital rim and sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat and periosteum, which was separated from the inferior orbital rim.  The orbital fat was sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat with multiple preplaced sutures of 5-0 Vicryl on a P2 needle.  The upper eyelid incision was closed with a running subcuticular 6-0 Prolene suture bilaterally.  The forehead was then elevated, and the nonhairbearing forehead skin was resected 1.5 cm wide raising the tail of the eyebrow.  The head of the eyebrow was felt to be elevated by the antagonistic frontalis muscle now that the accessory muscles specifically the corrugator and procerus and depressor supercilii were released and divided.,A lateral canthopexy was performed with 5-0 Prolene suture on a C1 double-arm tapered needle being passed from the lateral commissure of the eyelid to the small stab incision being passed to the medial superior orbital rim and sutured to tighten the lower lid.  The distal lateral resection of excessive lower eyelid skin was reduced at risk of eyelid malposition.  The lower lid incision was closed after the redundancy of skin measuring approximately 3 mm was resected on both sides.  Closure was performed with interrupted 6-0 silk suture for the lower lid.  The eyebrow hairline brow lift was closed with interrupted 4-0 PDS suture, deep subcutaneous tissue, and dermis, and the skin closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.,Attention then was directed to the cervical facial rhytidectomy and purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.  Incisions were made in preauricular area, postauricular area, mastoid and occipital area.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed to the nasolabial fold and cheek and extending across the neck in the midline.  Submental lipectomy was performed through the incision in the submental crease.  Fat was directly removed from the fascia.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A SMAS elevation was performed with a purse-string suture of 2-0 PDS suture from temporalis fascia in front of the ear extending beneath the mandible and then brought back up to be sutured to the temporalis fascia.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The cheek flap was brought back posteriorly and the cervical flap posteriorly and superiorly with redundant skin on the right massaged and closed.  The skin of the cheek and neck were resected which was redundant after the ***** posteriorly and superiorly in the neck and transversely in the cheek.,Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 PDS suture of deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis of the skin was closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.  Drains were placed prior to final closure.  A 7-mm flat Jackson-Pratt was then secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Dressing consisting of fluffs and Kerlix and a 4-inch Ace were applied to support mildly compressive dressing.  Scleral eye protectors were removed.  Maxitrol eye ointment was placed followed by Swiss therapy eye pads.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and she returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition with Foley catheter and Pneumatic compression stockings, TED hose, two Jackson-Pratt drains, and an IV.

PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.

The patient has now begun to have comorbidities related to the obesity.  The patient has attended our bariatric seminar and met with our dietician and psychologist.  The patient has read through our comprehensive handout and understands the risks and benefits of bypass surgery as evidenced by the signing of our consent form.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The risks and benefits were explained to the patient.  Consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and sequential compression devices were placed on the legs.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard, sterile, surgical fashion.  Marcaine was injected into the umbilicus.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Transient visual loss lasting five minutes.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a very active and pleasant 82-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for first-degree AV block, status post pacemaker placement, hypothyroidism secondary to hyperthyroidism and irradiation, possible lumbar stenosis.  He reports he experienced a single episode of his vision decreasing "like it was compressed from the top down with a black sheet coming down".  The episode lasted approximately five minutes and occurred three weeks ago while he was driving a car.  He was able to pull the car over to the side of the road safely.  During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded.  His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode.  He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable.  It was suggested at that time that he get a CT angiogram since he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker.  He has had no further similar events.  He denies any lesions or other visual change, focal weakness or sensory change, headaches, gait change or other neurological problem.,He also reports that he has been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis based on some mild difficulty arising from a chair for which an outside physician ordered a CT of his L-spine that reportedly showed lumbar stenosis.  The question has arisen as to whether he should have a CT myelogram to further evaluate this process.  He has no back pain or pain of any type, he denies bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness.  He is extremely active and plays tennis at least three times a week.  He denies recent episodes of unexpected falls.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He only endorses hypothyroidism, the episode of visual loss described above and joint pain.  He also endorses having trouble getting out of a chair, but otherwise his review of systems is negative.  A copy is in his clinic chart.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As above.  He has had bilateral knee replacement three years ago and experiences some pain in his knees with this.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is retired from the social security administration x 20 years.  He travels a lot and is extremely active.  He does not smoke.  He consumes alcohol socially only.  He does not use illicit drugs.  He is married.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient has recently been started on Plavix by his primary care doctor, was briefly on baby aspirin 81 mg per day since the TIA-like event three weeks ago.  He also takes Proscar 5 mg q.d and Synthroid 0.2 mg q.d.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  BP 134/80, heart rate 60, respiratory rate 16, and weight 244 pounds.  He denies any pain.,General:  This is a pleasant white male in no acute distress.,HEENT:  He is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  There is no sinus tenderness.,Neck:  Supple.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  There are no bruits present.,Extremities:  Extremities are warm and dry.  Distal pulses are full.  There is no edema.,NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:,MENTAL STATUS:  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with good recent and long-term memory.  His language is fluent.  His attention and concentration are good.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  VFFTC, PERRL, EOMI, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, hearing is decreased on the right (hearing aid), palate rises symmetrically, shoulder shrug is strong, tongue protrudes in the midline.,MOTOR:  He has normal bulk and tone throughout.  There is no cogwheeling.  There is some minimal weakness at the iliopsoas bilaterally 4+/5 and possibly trace weakness at the quadriceps -5/5.  Otherwise he is 5/5 throughout including hip adductors and abductors.,SENSORY:  He has decreased sensation to vibration and proprioception to the middle of his feet only, otherwise sensory is intact to light touch, and temperature, pinprick, proprioception and vibration.,COORDINATION:  There is no dysmetria or tremor noted.  His Romberg is negative.  Note that he cannot rise from the chair without using his arms.,GAIT:  Upon arising, he has a normal step, stride, and toe, heel.  He has difficulty with tandem and tends to fall to the left.,REFLEXES:  2 at biceps, triceps, patella and 1 at ankles.,The patient provided a CT scan without contrast from his previous hospitalization three weeks ago, which is normal to my inspection.,He has had full labs for cholesterol and stroke for risk factors although he does not have those available here.,IMPRESSION:,1.  TIA.  The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation.  Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection.  He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system.  He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued.  Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup.  The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time.,2.  Lumbar stenosis.  His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability.  In the absence of motor stabilizing symptoms, the patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time.  Therefore we would defer further evaluation with CT myelogram as he does not want surgery.,PLAN:,1.  We will get a CT angiogram of the cerebral vessels.,2.  Continue Plavix.,3.  Obtain copies of the workup done at the outside hospital.,4.  We will follow the lumbar stenosis for the time being.  No further workup is planned.

Requested sterilization.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,1.  Intrauterine pregnancy at 33 weeks, twin gestation.,2.  Active preterm labor.,3.  Advanced dilation.,4.  Multiparity.,5.  Requested sterilization.,6.  Delivery of a viable female A weighing 4 pounds 7 ounces, Apgars were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively and female B weighing 4 pounds 9 ounces, Apgars 6 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively.,7.  Uterine adhesions and omentum adhesions.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Repeat low-transverse C-section, lysis of omental adhesions, lysis of uterine adhesions with repair of uterine defect, and bilateral tubal ligation.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,DRAINS:,  Foley.,This is a 25-year-old white female gravida 3, para 2-0-0-2 with twin gestation at 33 weeks and previous C-section.  The patient presents to Labor and Delivery in active preterm labor and dilated approximately 4 to 6 cm.  The decision for C-section was made.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position with a slight left lateral tilt and she was then prepped and draped in usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  The patient was then given general anesthesia and once this was completed, first knife was used to make a low transverse incision extending down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion with the use of curved Mayo scissors.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection was then completed both caudally and cephalically.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center and extended in a vertical fashion.  Peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  The bladder blade was put in place.  The bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum scissors and dissected away caudally.  The second knife was used to make a low transverse incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of the fetus.  The first fetus was vertex.  The fluid was clear.  The head was delivered followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician and nursery personnel.  The second fluid was ruptured.  It was the clear fluid as well.  The presenting part was brought down to be vertex.  The head was delivered followed by the rest of the body and the cord was doubly clamped and cut, and newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician in addition of the nursery personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained from both of the cords with careful identification of A and B. Once this was completed, the placenta was delivered and handed off for further inspection by Pathology.  At this time, it was noted at the uterus was adhered to the abdominal wall by approximately of 3 cm x 3 cm thick uterine adhesion and this was needed to be released by sharp dissection.  Then, there were multiple omental adhesions on the surface of the uterus itself.  This needed to be released as well as on the abdominal wall and then the uterus could be externalized.  The lining was wiped clean of any remaining blood and placental fragments and the edges of the uterus were grasped in four quadrants with Kocher and continuous locking stitch of 0 chromic was used to re-approximate the uterine incision, with the second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam underneath.  The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock, it was doubly tied off with 0 chromic and the knuckle portion was then sharply incised and cauterized.  The same technique was completed on the left side with the knuckle portion cut off and cauterized as well.  The defect on the uterine surface was reinforced with 0 Vicryl in a baseball stitch to create adequate Hemostasis.  Interceed was placed over this area as well.  The abdominal cavity was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The edges of the peritoneum were grasped with hemostats and a continuous locking stitch was used to re-approximate abdominal rectus muscles as well as the peritoneal edges.  The abdominal rectus muscle was irrigated.  The corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl started on both corners and overlapped on the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the subcutaneous tissue.  Skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Uterus was evacuated of any remaining blood vaginally.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct.

SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 75-year-old female who comes in today with concerns of having a stroke.  She states she feels like she has something in her throat.  She started with some dizziness this morning and some left hand and left jaw numbness.  She said that she apparently had something about three weeks ago where she was dizzy and ended up falling down and she saw Dr. XYZ for that who gave her some Antivert.  She said that today though she woke up in the middle of the night and her left hand was numb and she was having numbness on the left side of her face, as well as the left side of her neck.  She said she had an earache a day or so ago.  She has not had any cold symptoms.,ALLERGIES:,  Demerol and codeine.,MEDICATIONS: , Lotensin, Lopid, metoprolol, and Darvocet.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  The patient says that she feels little bit nauseated at times.  She denies chest pain or shortness of breath and again feels like she has something in her throat.  She has been able to swallow liquids okay.  She said that she did brush her teeth this morning and did not have any fluid dripping out of her mouth.  She does say that she occasionally has numbness in her left hand prior to today.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  She is awake and alert, no acute distress.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  175/86.  Temperature:  She is afebrile.  Pulse:  78.  Respiratory rate:  20.  O2 sat:  93% on room air.,HEENT:  Her TMs are normal bilaterally.  Posterior pharynx is unremarkable.

The only EKG I have here is from 1998 and she actually had bypass in 1999, but there certainly does not appear to be anything acute on his EKG.  I assured her that it does not look like she has a stroke.  If she wants to prevent a stroke, obviously quitting her smoking would help.  It should be noted she also takes Synthroid and Zocor.  We are going to give her Valtrex 1 g t.i.d. for seven days and then if she starts noticing any other drooping or worsening of her symptoms on the left side of her face, she needs to come back, but I will not start her on steroids at this time, which she agreed with.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Postoperative hemorrhage.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Postoperative hemorrhage.,SURGICAL PROCEDURE:  ,Examination under anesthesia with control of right parapharyngeal space hemorrhage.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal technique.,SURGICAL FINDINGS: , Right lower pole bleeder cauterized with electrocautery with good hemostasis.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: , The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of a chronic pharyngitis and obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy.  Previously, in the day she had undergone a tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy and was recovering without difficulty.  However, in the PACU after a coughing spell she began bleeding from the right oropharynx, and was taken back to the operative suite for control of hemorrhage.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was placed supine on the operating room table and general anesthetic was administered, once appropriate anesthetic findings achieved the patient was intubated and then prepped and draped in usual sterile manner for a parapharyngeal space hemorrhage.  A Crowe-Davis type mouth gag was introduced in the oropharynx and under operating headlight the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  There was a small bleeder present at the inferior mid pole of the right oropharynx in the tonsillar fossa, this area was cauterized with suction cautery and irrigated.  There was no other bleeding noted.  The patient was repositioned and the mouth gag, the tongue was rotated to the left side of the mouth and the right parapharyngeal space carefully examined.  There was a small amount of oozing noted in the right tonsillar bed, and this was cauterized with suction cautery.  No other bleeding was noted and the patient was recovered from general anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to postoperative recovery room area.  Prior to extubation the patient's tonsillar fossa were injected with a 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with 1:100,000 adrenalin solution to facilitate postoperative analgesia and hemostasis.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed in the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic.,Ancef 1 g was given for infectious prophylaxis.  Once the patient was under general anesthesia, the knee was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Once the knee was fully prepped and draped, then we made 2 standard portals medial and lateral.  Through the lateral portal, the camera was placed.  Through the medial portal, tools were placed.  We proceeded to examine scarring of the patellofemoral joint.  Then we probed the patellofemoral joint.  A chondroplasty was performed using a shaver.  Then we moved down to the lateral gutter.  Some loose bodies were found using a shaver and dissection.  We moved down the medial gutter.  No plica was found.,We moved into the medial joint; we found that the medial meniscus was intact.  We moved to the lateral joint and found that the lateral meniscus was intact.  Pictures were taken.  We drained the knee and washed out the knee with copious amounts of sterile saline solution.  The instruments were removed.  The 2 portals were closed using 3-0 nylon suture.  Xeroform, 4 x 4s, Kerlix x2, and TED stocking were placed.  The patient was successfully extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.  I then spoke with the family going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Missed abortion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Missed abortion.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Suction, dilation, and curettage.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  50 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS: , Products of conception consistent with a 6-week intrauterine pregnancy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 28-year-old gravida 4, para 3 female at 13 weeks by her last menstrual period and 6 weeks by an ultrasound today in the emergency room who presents with heavy bleeding starting today.  A workup done in the emergency room revealed a beta-quant level of 1931 and an ultrasound showing an intrauterine pregnancy with a crown-rump length consistent with a 6-week and 2-day pregnancy.  No heart tones were visible.  On examination in the emergency room, a moderate amount of bleeding was noted.,Additionally, the cervix was noted to be 1 cm dilated.  These findings were discussed with the patient and options including surgical management via dilation and curettage versus management with misoprostol versus expected management were discussed with the patient.  After discussion of these options, the patient opted for a suction, dilation, and curettage.  The patient was described to the patient in detail including risks of infection, bleeding, injury to surrounding organs including risk of perforation.  Informed consent was obtained prior to proceeding with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was administered without difficulty.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion in lithotomy position.  A weighted speculum was placed.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a single tooth tenaculum.  At this time, a 7-mm suction curettage was advanced into the uterine cavity without difficulty and was used to suction contents of the uterus.  Following removal of the products of conception, a sharp curette was advanced into the uterine cavity and was used to scrape the four walls of the uterus until a gritty texture was noted.  At this time, the suction curette was advanced one additional time to suction any remaining products.  All instruments were removed.  Hemostasis was visualized.  The patient was stable at the completion of the procedure.  Sponge, lap, and instrument counts were correct.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy, allograft fusion, and anterior plating.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 10 mL.,CLINICAL NOTE: , This is a 57-year-old gentleman with refractory neck pain with single-level degeneration of the cervical spine and there was also some arm pain.  We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.
SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.,ALLERGIES: , Sulfa.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  As I have given are Levaquin, Prinivil 20 mg a day, Bumex 0.5 mg a day, Levsinex 0.375 mg a day, cimetidine 400 mg a day, potassium chloride 8 mEq a day, and atenolol 25 mg a day.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She says she is voiding okay.  She denies fever, chills, or sweats.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  She was able to get up on the table by herself although she is quite unstable.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure was okay at about 120/70 by me.,Neck:  Supple.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft.,Extremities:  There is no edema.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Hypertension controlled.,2.  Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy and stent placed in the left ureter by Dr. F.,3.  Urinary incontinence.,4.  Recent sepsis.,PLAN:,1.  I discussed at length with she and her husband again the need to get into at least an assisted living apartment.,2.  I gave her instructions, in writing, to stop by Dr. F’s office on the way out today to get an appointment for followup regarding her stent.,3.  See me back here in two months.,4.  I made no changes in her medications.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Abnormal uterine bleeding.,2.  Uterine fibroids.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Abnormal uterine bleeding.,2.  Uterine fibroids.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual manner for a laparoscopic procedure.  A speculum was placed into the vagina.  A single tooth tenaculum was utilized to grasp the anterior lip of the uterine cervix.  The uterus was sounded to 10.5 cm.  A #10 RUMI cannula was utilized and attached for uterine manipulation.  The single-tooth tenaculum and speculum were removed from the vagina.  At this time, the infraumbilical area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and infraumbilical vertical skin incision was made through which a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  Aspiration was negative; therefore the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide.  After adequate insufflation, Veress needle was removed and an 11-mm separator trocar was introduced through the infraumbilical incision into the abdominal cavity.  Through the trocar sheath, the laparoscope was inserted and adequate visualization of the pelvic structures was noted.  At this time, the suprapubic area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine.  A 5-mm skin incision was made and a 5-mm trocar was introduced into the abdominal cavity for instrumentation.  Evaluation of the pelvis revealed the uterus to be slightly enlarged and irregular.  The fallopian tubes have been previously interrupted surgically.  The ovaries appeared normal bilaterally.  The cul-de-sac was clean without evidence of endometriosis, scarring or adhesions.  The ureters were noted to be deep in the pelvis.  At this time, the right cornu was grasped and the right fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected without difficulty.  The remainder of the uterine vessels and anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligament, as well as the cardinal ligament was coagulated and transected in a serial fashion down to level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  A similar procedure was carried out on the left with the left uterine cornu identified.  The left fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The remainder of the cardinal ligament, uterine vessels, anterior, and posterior sheaths of the broad ligament were coagulated and transected in a serial manner to the level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was then dissected to the midline bilaterally, establishing a bladder flap with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  At this time, attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The laparoscope was removed and attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The RUMI cannula was removed and the anterior and posterior leafs of the cervix were grasped with Lahey tenaculum.  A circumferential injection with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was made at the cervicovaginal portio.  A circumferential incision was then made at the cervicovaginal portio.  The anterior and posterior colpotomies were accomplished with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection without difficulty.  The right uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The left uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The parametrial tissue was then clamped bilaterally, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture bilaterally.  The uterus was then removed and passed off the operative field.  Laparotomy pack was placed into the pelvis.  The pedicles were evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted; therefore, the laparotomy pack was removed.  The uterosacral ligaments were suture fixated into the vaginal cuff angles with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The vaginal cuff was then closed in a running fashion with #0 Vicryl suture.  Hemostasis was noted throughout.  At this time, the laparoscope was reinserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was reinsufflated.  Evaluation revealed no further bleeding.  Irrigation with sterile water was performed and again no bleeding was noted.  The suprapubic trocar sheath was then removed under laparoscopic visualization.  The laparoscope was removed.  The carbon dioxide was allowed to escape from the abdomen and the infraumbilical trocar sheath was then removed.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Neosporin and Band-Aid were applied for dressing and the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 100 mL.  There were no complications.  The instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids, and also foreign body of right ear.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids, and also foreign body of right ear.,OPERATIONS:,  Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and removal of foreign body (rock) from right ear.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,HISTORY: , The patient is 5-1/2 years old.  She is here this morning with her Mom.  She has very large tonsils and she snores at night and gets up frequently at night and does not sleep well.  At the office we saw the tonsils were very big.  There was a rock in the right ear and it was very deep in the canal, near the drum.  We will remove the foreign body under the same anesthetic.,PROCEDURE:,:  Natalie was placed under general anesthetic by the orotracheal route of administration, under Dr. XYZ and Ms. B.  I looked into the left ear under the microscope, took out a little wax and observed a normal eardrum.  On the right side, I took out some impacted wax and removed the rock with a large suction.  It was actually resting on the surface of the drum but had not scarred or damaged the drum.  The drum was intact with no evidence of middle ear fluid.  The microscope was set aside.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils.  The neck was gently extended and the Crowe-Davis mouth gag inserted.  The tonsils and adenoids were very large.  The uvula was intact.  Adenoidectomy was performed using the adenoid curette with a tonsil sponge placed into the nasopharynx.  Tonsillectomy accomplished by sharp and blunt dissection.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery and the tonsils beds injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  Sutures of zero plain catgut next were used to re-approximate the posterior to the anterior tonsillar pillars, suturing these down to the tonsillar beds.  Sponge is removed from the nasopharynx.  The suction electrocautery was used for pinpoint hemostasis on the adenoid bed.  We made sure the cautery tip did not come into the contact with the soft palate or the eustachian tube orifices.  The nose and throat were then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  Excellent hemostasis was observed.  An orogastric tube was placed.  The stomach found to be empty.  The tube was removed, as was the mouth gag.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The child was then awakened and prepared for her to return to the recovery room.  She tolerated the operation excellently.
DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM,REASON FOR EXAM: , Chest discomfort, evaluation for coronary artery disease.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cardiac center.  Cardiac images at rest were obtained in the parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two views followed by starting with a dobutamine drip in the usual fashion at 10 mcg/kg per minute for low dose, increased every 2 to 3 minutes by 10 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient maximized at 30 mcg/kg per minute.  Images were obtained at that level after adding 0.7 mg of atropine to reach maximal heart rate of 145.  Maximal images were obtained in the same windows of parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two windows.,Wall motion assessed at all levels as well as at recovery.,The patient got nauseated, had some mild shortness of breath.  No angina during the procedure and the maximal amount of dobutamine was 30 mcg/kg per minute.,The resting heart rate was 78 with the resting blood pressure 186/98.  Heart rate reduced by the vasodilator effects of dobutamine to 130/80.  Maximal heart rate achieved was 145, which is 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,The EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave depression suggestive of ischemia or injury.  Incomplete right bundle-branch block was seen.  The maximal stress test EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  There was subtle upsloping ST depression in III and aVF, which is a normal response to the tachycardia with dobutamine, but no significant depression suggestive of ischemia and no ST elevation seen.,No ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopy seen during the test.  The heart rate recovered in a normal fashion after using metoprolol 5 mg.,The heart images were somewhat suboptimal to evaluate because of obesity and some problems with the short axis windows mainly at peak exercise.,The EF at rest appeared to be normal at 55 to 60 with normal wall motion including anterior, anteroseptal, inferior, lateral, and septal walls at low dose.  All walls mentioned were augmented in a normal fashion.  At maximum dose, all walls were augmented on all views except for the short axis was foreshortened, was uncertain about the anterolateral wall at peak exercise; however, of the other views, the lateral wall was showing normal thickening and normal augmentation.  EF improved to about 70%.,The wall motion score was unchanged.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Maximal dobutamine stress echocardiogram test achieving more than 85% of age-predicted heart rate.,2.

This is considered the negative dobutamine stress echocardiogram test, medical management.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Symptomatic cholelithiasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Symptomatic cholelithiasis.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy (CPT 47563, 44970).,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is an 18-year-old girl with sickle cell anemia who has had symptomatic cholelithiasis.  She requested appendectomy because of the concern of future diagnostic dilemma with pain crisis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were recommended to her.  The procedure was explained in detail including the risks of bleeding, infection, biliary injury, retained common duct stones.  After answering her questions, she wished to proceed and gave informed consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed.  After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped.,The infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created.  The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity.  Upper abdominal anatomy was normal.  Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings.  Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____.  There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region.  Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad.  Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction.  A small ductotomy was created.  Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated.  Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material.  This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction.  There was no evidence of common bile duct stones.  The cholangiogram catheter was removed.  The duct was doubly clipped and divided.  The artery was divided and cauterized.  The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa.  It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen.  Attention was then paid to the appendix.  The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base.  This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler.  The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler.  This was placed in another Endocatch bag.  The abdomen was then irrigated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  Both the appendix and gallbladder were removed and sent for pathology.  All trocars were removed.  The 12-mm port sites were closed with 2-0 PDS figure-of-eight fascial sutures.  The umbilical skin was reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The remaining skin incisions were closed with 5-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.  The skin was cleaned.  Mastisol, Steri-Strips and band-aids were applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated in the operating room, transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Buttock abscess.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This patient is a 24-year-old African-American female who presented to the hospital with buttock pain.  She started off with a little pimple on the buttock.  She was soaking it at home without any improvement.  She came to the hospital on the first.  The patient underwent incision and drainage in the emergency department.  She was admitted to the hospitalist service with elevated blood sugars.  She has had positive blood cultures.  Surgery is consulted today for evaluation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Diabetes type II, poorly controlled, high cholesterol.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , C-section and D&C.,ALLERGIES:,  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,MEDICATIONS: , Insulin, metformin, Glucotrol, and Lipitor.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, Parkinson disease, and heart disease.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Significant for pain in the buttock.  Otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is an overweight African-American female not in any distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  She has been afebrile since admission.  Vital signs have been stable.  Blood sugars have been in the 200 range.,HEENT:  Normal to inspection.,NECK:  No bruits or adenopathy.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.,CV:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Protuberant, soft, and nontender.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,RECTAL EXAM:  The patient has a drained abscess on the buttock cheek.  There is some serosanguineous drainage.  There is no longer any purulent drainage.  The wound appears relatively clean.  I do not see a lot of erythema.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Left buttock abscess, status post incision and drainage.  I do not believe surgical intervention is warranted.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: , Hyperglycemia, cholelithiasis, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: , Hyperglycemia, cholelithiasis, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cholecystitis.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,SERVICE: , Surgery.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. ABC is a 57-year-old woman.  She suffers from morbid obesity.  She also has diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  She was evaluated in the Bariatric Surgical Center for placement of a band.  During her workup, she was noted to have evidence of cholelithiasis.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her hyperglycemia.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the hospital.  She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,To return to the Medifast diet.  To continue with her blood glucose.  She needs to follow up with Dr. B, and she will see me next week on Friday.  We will determine if we will proceed with her lap band at that time.  She may shower.  She needs to keep her wounds clean and dry.  No heavy lifting.  No driving on narcotic pain medicines.  She needs to continue with her CPAP machine and continue to monitor her sugars.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux rigidus, left foot.,2.  Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux rigidus, left foot.,2.  Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Austin/Youngswick bunionectomy with Biopro implant.,2.  Screw fixation, left foot.,HISTORY: , This 51-year-old male presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time.  The patient desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made.  Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx.  There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease.  There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal.  There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail.  After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact.  The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp.  The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant.  A large was noted to be of the best size.  There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx.  Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base.  A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer.  The bone was noted to be significantly hardened.  The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant.  The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal.  The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process.  The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit.  There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant.,Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal.  A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created.  A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site.  The wedge was then removed in toto.  The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site.  The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position.  The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires.  A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion.  A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion.  With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites.,The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash.  A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl.  Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  A total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected intraoperatively for further anesthesia.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin ES and instructed to take 1 q.  4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. pain.  The patient was instructed to ice and elevate his left lower extremity as much as possible to help decrease postoperative edema.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.
ADENOIDECTOMY,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought into the operating room suite, anesthesia administered via endotracheal tube.  Following this the patient was draped in standard fashion.  The Crowe-Davis mouth gag was inserted in the oral cavity.  The palate and tonsils were inspected, the palate was suspended with a red rubber catheter passed through the right nostril.  Following this, the mirror was used to visualize the adenoid pad and an adenoid curet was seated against the vomer.  The adenoid pad was removed without difficulty.  The nasopharynx was packed.  Following this, the nasopharynx was unpacked, several discrete bleeding sites were gently coagulated with electrocautery and the nasopharynx and oral cavity were irrigated.  The Crowe-Davis was released.,The patient tolerated the procedure without difficulty and was in stable condition on transfer to recovery.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Lumbar osteomyelitis.,2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Lumbar osteomyelitis.,2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE:,  Placement of left subclavian 4-French Broviac catheter.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a toddler admitted with a limp and back pain, who was eventually found on bone scan and septic workup to have probable osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine at disk areas.  The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.

HISTORY: , The patient is a 48-year-old female who was seen in consultation requested from Dr. X on 05/28/2008 regarding chronic headaches and pulsatile tinnitus.  The patient reports she has been having daily headaches since 02/25/2008.  She has been getting pulsations in the head with heartbeat sounds.  Headaches are now averaging about three times per week.  They are generally on the very top of the head according to the patient.  Interestingly, she denies any previous significant history of headaches prior to this.  There has been no nausea associated with the headaches.  The patient does note that when she speaks on the phone, the left ear has "weird sounds."  She feels a general fullness in the left ear.  She does note pulsation sounds within that left ear only.  This began on February 17th according to the patient.  The patient reports that the ear pulsations began following an air flight to Iowa where she was visiting family.  The patient does admit that the pulsations in the ears seem to be somewhat better over the past few weeks.  Interestingly, there has been no significant drop or change in her hearing.  She does report she has had dizzy episodes in the past with nausea, being off balance at times.  It is not associated with the pulsations in the ear.  She does admit the pulsations will tend to come and go and there had been periods where the pulsations have completely cleared in the ear.  She is denying any vision changes.  The headaches are listed as moderate to severe in intensity on average about three to four times per week.  She has been taking Tylenol and Excedrin to try to control the headaches and that seems to be helping somewhat.  The patient presents today for further workup, evaluation, and treatment of the above-listed symptoms.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , ,ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGIC:  Negative.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Hypercholesterolemia.,PULMONARY:  Negative.,GASTROINTESTINAL:  Pertinent for nausea.,GENITOURINARY:  The patient is noted to be a living kidney donor and has only one kidney.,NEUROLOGIC:  History of dizziness and the headaches as listed above.,VISUAL:  Negative.,DERMATOLOGIC:  History of itching.  She has also had a previous history of skin cancer on the arm and back.,ENDOCRINE:  Negative.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Negative.,CONSTITUTIONAL:  She has had an increased weight gain and fatigue over the past year.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  She has had a left nephrectomy, C-sections, mastoidectomy, laparoscopy, and T&A.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Father, history of cancer, hypertension, and heart disease.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Tylenol, Excedrin, and she is on multivitamin and probiotic's.,ALLERGIES: , She is allergic to codeine and penicillin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She is married.  She works at Eye Center as a receptionist.  She denies tobacco at this time though she was a previous smoker, stopped four years ago, and she denies alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 120/78, pulse 64 and regular, and the temperature is 97.4.,GENERAL:  The patient is an alert, cooperative, well-developed 48-year-old female with a normal-sounding voice and good memory.,HEAD & FACE:  Inspected with no scars, lesions or masses noted.  Sinuses palpated and are normal.  Salivary glands also palpated and are normal with no masses noted.  The patient also has full facial function.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.,RESPIRATORY:  Lungs auscultated and noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezing or rubs and normal respiratory effort.,EYES:  Extraocular muscles were tested and within normal limits.,EARS:  There is an old mastoidectomy scar, left ear.  The ear canals are clean and dry.  Drums intact and mobile.  Weber exam is midline.  Grossly hearing is intact.  Please note audiologist not available at today's visit for further audiologic evaluation.,NASAL:  Reveals clear drainage.  Deviated nasal septum to the left, listed as mild to moderate.  Ostiomeatal complexes are patent and turbinates are healthy.  There was no mass or neoplasm within the nasopharynx noted on fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy.  See fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy separate exam.,ORAL:  Oral cavity is normal with good moisture.  Lips, teeth and gums are normal.  Evaluation of the oropharynx reveals normal mucosa, normal palates, and posterior oropharynx.  Examination of the larynx with a mirror reveals normal epiglottis, false and true vocal cords with good mobility of the cords.  The nasopharynx was briefly examined by mirror with normal appearing mucosa, posterior choanae and eustachian tubes.,NECK:  The neck was examined with normal appearance.  Trachea in the midline.

Pulsatile tinnitus, left ear with eustachian tube disorder as the etiology.  Consider, also normal pressure hydrocephalus.,2.  Recurrent headaches.,3.  Deviated nasal septum.,4.  Dizziness, again also consider possible Meniere disease.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I did recommend the patient begin a 2 g or less sodium diet.  I have also ordered a carotid ultrasound study as part of the workup and evaluation.  She has had a recent CAT scan of the brain though this was without contrast.  It did reveal previous mastoidectomy, left temporal bone, but no other mass noted.  I have started her on Nasacort AQ nasal spray one spray each nostril daily as this is eustachian tube related.  Hearing protection devices should be used at all times as well.  I did counsel the patient if she has any upcoming airplane trips to use nasal decongestant or topical nasal decongestant spray prior to boarding the plane, and also using the airplane ear plugs as these can be effective at helping to prevent eustachian tube issues.  I am going to recheck her in three weeks.  If the pulsatile tinnitus at that time is not clear, we have discussed other treatment options including myringotomy or ear tube placement, which could be done here in the office.  She will be scheduled for a audio and tympanogram to be done as well prior to that procedure.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  ,Abnormal echocardiogram findings and followup.  Shortness of breath, congestive heart failure, and valvular insufficiency.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is an 86-year-old female admitted for evaluation of abdominal pain and bloody stools.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes, bilateral intraabdominal testes.,PROCEDURE: , Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED:  ,110 mL of crystalloid.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Atrophic bilateral testes, right is larger than left.  The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic right inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh, as well as a circumcision.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.,SPECIMEN: , Foreskin.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This patient is a 66-year-old African-American male who presented to Dr. Y's office with recurrent right inguinal hernia for the second time requesting hernia repair.  The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right.  The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced.  The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg.  Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored.  There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible.  Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus.  Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization.  A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization.  Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral.  The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty.  Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum.  This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety.  Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract.  The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples.  This was done without difficulty.  All three ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision.  The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head.  The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker.  The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head.  A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen.  This was done without difficulty.  Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially.  This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis.,A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition.
SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today’s reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague “stomach problems”, although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATION: , Verapamil 240 mg a day, Mavik 1 mg a day, Lipitor 10 mg one and half daily, vitamins daily, Ocuvite daily, Tums t.i.d., Tylenol 2-3 daily p.r.n., and Mylanta at night.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Mostly otherwise as above.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  She is a pleasant elderly lady.  She is in no acute distress, accompanied by daughter.,Vital signs:  Blood pressure:  128/82.  Pulse:  68.  Weight:  143 pounds.,HEENT:  No acute changes.  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  On mouth exam, she does have dentures.  She removed her upper denture.  I really do not see any sores at all.  Her mouth exam was unremarkable.,Neck:  No adenopathy, tenderness, JVD, bruits, or mass.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Extremities:  No significant edema.  Reasonable pulses.  No clubbing or cyanosis, may be just a minimal tremor in head and hands, but it is very subtle and hardly noticeable.  No other focal or neurological deficits grossly.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Hypertension, better reading today.,2.  Right arm symptoms, resolved.,3.  Depression probably somewhat improved with Lexapro and she will just continue that.  She only got up to the full dose 10 mg pill about a week ago and apparently some days does not need to take it.,4.  Perhaps a very subtle tremor.  I will just watch that.,5.  Osteoporosis.,6.  Osteoarthritis.,PLAN:,  I think I will just watch everything for now.  I would continue the Lexapro, we gave her more samples plus a prescription for the 20 mg that she can cut in half.  I offered to see her for again short-term followup.  However, they both preferred just to wait until the annual check up already set up for next April and they know they can call sooner.  She might get a flu shot here in the next few weeks.  Daughter mentioned here today that she thinks her mom is doing pretty well, especially given that she is turning 90 here later this month and I would tend to agree with that.
DIAGNOSES:,1.  Cervical dystonia.,2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Macular edema, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Macular edema, right eye.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Insertion of radioactive plaque, right eye with lateral canthotomy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for a local eye procedure.  Initially, a 5 cc retrobulbar injection of 2% Xylocaine was done.  Then, a lid speculum was inserted and the conjunctiva was incised 4 mm posterior to the limbus.  A 2-0 silk traction suture was placed around the insertion of the lateral rectus muscle and, with gentle traction, the temporal one-half of the globe was exposed.  The plaque was positioned on the scleral surface immediately behind the macula and secured with two sutures of 5-0 Dacron.  The placement was confirmed with indirect ophthalmoscopy.  Next, the eye was irrigated with Neosporin and the conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain catgut.  The intraocular pressure was found to be within normal limits.  An eye patch was applied and the patient was sent to the Recovery Room in good condition.  A lateral canthotomy had been done.
EXAM:,MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST,CLINICAL:,Left knee pain. Twisting injury.,FINDINGS:,The images reveal a sizable joint effusion. The joint effusion appears to be complex with mixed signal intensity material within. The patella is slightly laterally tilted towards the left. The mid portion of the patella cartilage shows some increased signal and focal injury to the patellar cartilage is suspected. Mildly increased bone signal overlying the inferolateral portion of the patella is identified. No significant degenerative changes about the patella can be seen. The quadriceps tendon as well as the infrapatellar ligament both look intact. There is some prepatellar soft tissue edema.,The bone signal shows a couple of small areas of cystic change in the proximal aspect of the tibia. NO significant areas of bone edema are appreciated.,There is soft tissue edema along the lateral aspect of the knee. There is a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. The medial collateral ligament complex looks intact. A small amount of edema is identified immediately adjacent to the medial collateral ligament complex.,The posterior cruciate ligament looks intact. The anterior cruciate ligament is thickened with significant increased signal. I suspect at least a high grade partial tear.,The posterior horn of the medial meniscus shows some myxoid degenerative changes. The posterior horn and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus likewise shows myxoid degenerative type changes. I don’t see a definite tear extending to the articular surface.,IMPRESSION:,Sizeable joint effusion which is complex and may contain blood products.,Myxoid degenerative type changes medial and lateral meniscus with no definite evidence of a tear.,Soft tissue swelling and partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex.,At least high grade partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament with significant thickening and increased signal of this structure.,The posterior cruciate ligament is intact.,Injury to the patellar cartilage as above.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,1.  Fever.,2.  Otitis media.,3.  Possible sepsis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 10-month-old male who was seen in the office 1 day prior to admission.  He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.,LABORATORY FINDINGS: , He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: , He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.  He has become afebrile and was having no further increased work of breathing.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bilateral otitis media.,2.  Fever.,PLAN:  ,Recommended discharge.  No restrictions in diet or activity.  He was continued Omnicef 125 mg/5 mL one teaspoon p.o. once daily and instructed to follow up with Dr. X, his primary doctor, on the following Tuesday.  Parents were instructed also to call if new symptoms occurred or he had return if difficulties with breathing or increased lethargy.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Cervical spondylosis and herniated nucleus pulposus of C4-C5.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cervical spondylosis and herniated nucleus pulposus of C4-C5.,TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Anterior cervical discectomy C4-C5 arthrodesis with 8 mm lordotic ACF spacer, corticocancellous, and stabilization with Synthes Vector plate and screws.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 100 mL.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  A shoulder roll was placed between the scapula and the head was rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position.  A preoperative x-ray was obtained to identify the operative level and neck position.  An incision was marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side.  The incision was opened with #10 blade knife.  Dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissues using Bovie electrocautery.  The platysma muscle was divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally.  The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection.  The avascular plane was then entered and dissection was carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia.  This was opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors.  The operative level was confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray.  The longus colli muscles were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator.  The anterior longitudinal ligament was then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5.  Self-retaining retractor was placed in submuscular position, and distraction pins were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5, and distraction was instituted.  We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy was now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes.  Operating microscope was draped and brought into play.  Dissection was carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette as we went.  We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spurs and osteophytes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Bone was then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament was now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch.  There was a transligamentous disc herniation, which was removed during this process.  We then carried out bilateral foraminotomies with removal of the uncovertebral osteophytes until the foramina were widely patent.  Cord was seen to be pulsating freely behind the dura.  There appeared to be no complications and the decompression appeared adequate.  We now used a cutting bit to prepare the inner space for arthrodesis fashioning a posterior ledge on the posterior aspect of the C5 vertebral body.  An 8 mm lordotic trial was used and appeared perfect.  We then used a corticocancellous 8 mm lordotic graft.  This was tapped into position.  Distraction was released, appeared to be in excellent position.  We then positioned an 18 mm Vector plate over the inner space.  Intraoperative x-ray was obtained with the stay screw in place; plates appeared to be in excellent position.  We then use a 14 mm self-tapping variable angle screws in each of the four locations drilling 14 mm pilot holes at each location prior to screw insertion.  All of the screws locked to the plate and this was confirmed on visual inspection.  Intraoperative x-ray was again obtained.  Construct appeared satisfactory.  Attention was then directed to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  All of the self-retaining retractors were removed.  Bleeding points were controlled with bone wax and bipolar electrocautery.  The platysma layer was now closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  A sterile bandage was applied.  All sponge, needle, and cottonoid counts were reported as correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently extubated in the operating room and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Rhabdomyosarcoma of the left orbit.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Rhabdomyosarcoma of the left orbit.,PROCEDURE: , Left subclavian vein MediPort placement (7.5-French single-lumen).,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This patient is a 16-year-old girl, with newly diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma of the left orbit.  The patient is being taken to the operating room for MediPort placement.  She needs chemotherapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient's neck, chest, and shoulders were prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made on the left shoulder area.  The left subclavian vein was cannulated.  The wire was passed, which was in good position under fluoro, using Seldinger Technique.  Near wire incision site made a pocket above the fascia and sutured in a size 7.5-French single-lumen MediPort into the pocket in 4 places using 3-0 Nurolon.  I then sized the catheter under fluoro and placed introducer and dilator over the wire, removed the wire and dilator, placed the catheter through the introducer and removed the introducer.  The line tip was in good position under fluoro.  It withdrew and flushed well.  I then closed the incision using 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Monocryl for the skin, and dressed with Steri-Strips.  Accessed the ports with a 1-inch 20-gauge Huber needle, and it withdrew and flushed well with final heparin flush.  We secured this with Tegaderm.  The patient is then to undergo bilateral bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture by Oncology.
PROCEDURES:,1.  Right frontal craniotomy with resection of right medial frontal brain tumor.,2.  Stereotactic image-guided neuronavigation for resection of tumor.,3.  Microdissection and micro-magnification for resection of brain tumor.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of left-sided weakness and headaches.  She has a previous history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, treated 2 years ago.  An MRI was obtained which showed a large enhancing mass in the medial right frontal lobe consistent with a metastatic lesion or possible primary brain tumor.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgery.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift, probable metastatic lung carcinoma.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled into the operating room and satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained via endotracheal tube.  She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured.,Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor.  We marked external landmarks.  Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area.  This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.,Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.,A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline.  This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips.  The skin flap was retracted medially.  Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected.  One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap.  Hemostasis was obtained.  Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was.  The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus.  We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain.  The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.,We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.,Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor.  Subsequently, we entered the tumor.  The tumor itself was extremely hard.  Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.,We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.,Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case.  We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.,Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor.  Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely.  In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out.  We resected the entire tumor.  Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained.,Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam.  We also lined the cavity with Surgicel.  The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained.,The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion.  Surgicel was placed over the dural closure.  The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators.  The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples.  The wound was dressed.  The patient was returned to the intensive care unit.  She was awake and moving extremities well.  No apparent complications were noted.  Needle and sponge counts were listed as correct at the end of the procedure.  Estimated intraoperative blood loss was approximately 150 mL and none was replaced.
REASON FOR CONSULT:,  Evaluation of alcohol withdrawal and dependance as well as evaluation of anxiety.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 50-year-old male who was transferred from Sugar Land ER to ABCD Hospital for admission to the MICU for acute alcohol withdrawal.  The patient had been on a drinking binge for the past 12 days prior to admission and had not been eating.  He reported that he called 911 secondary to noticing bilious vomiting and dry heave.  The patient has been drinking for the past 25 years and has noted it to be a problem for at least the past 3 years.  He has been away from work secondary to alcohol cravings and drinking.

XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear Dr. XYZ:,Thank you for your kind referral for patient ABC.  Mr. ABC is being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.  The patient states he has no visual complaints.,On examination, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally.  The patient's visual fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect and applanation pressures are 15 mmHg bilaterally.  On slit lamp examination, the patient has a normal anterior segment with 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  On dilated examination, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.  He has fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratios OU.  His intraocular pressures were within normal limits in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternatives of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photos of his optic nerves for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong findings suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific questions or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.  I have recommended him to follow up with you for continued examination, continued check-ups, and should you find any other abnormal findings, I would be happy to address those again.,Again, thank you for your referral of Mr. ABC.,Sincerely,,
CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Recurrent dizziness x1 month.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems including CHF (O2 dependent), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, possible stroke, multiple joint disease including gout, arthritis, both rheumatoid and DJD, who presents with a complaint of one month of dizziness.  She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place.  She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.  She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left.  She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up.  She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches.  She also notes occasional tinnitus to her right ear.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  CHF (uses portable oxygen).,2.  Atrial fibrillation.,3.  Gout.,4.  Arthritis (DJD/rheumatoid).,5.  Diabetes mellitus.,6.  Hypothyroidism.,7.  Hypertension.,8.  GERD.,9.  Possible stroke treated in 2003 at University of Maryland with acute onset of presyncopal sensations, sharp pains in the left side of her head and right-sided hemiparesis and numbness.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She is married.  She does not smoke, use alcohol or use illicit drugs.,MEDICATIONS: , Please see medication sheet in the chart.  It includes potassium, Pravachol, Prevacid, Synthroid, Diovan, Amaryl, Vitamin B12, Coreg, Coumadin, furosemide, Actos, aspirin, colchicine, Cipro, Percocet, Ultram (has held the latter two medications for the past two weeks due to concerns of exacerbating dizziness).,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Please see note in chart essentially entirely positive including cardiovascular problems of shortness of breath, PND and palpitations, chronic lack of energy, weight gain, the dizziness for which she presented.  Tinnitus in the right ear.  Diabetes and hypothyroidism.  Chronic nausea.  Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back.  Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking.  She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious.  She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply.  She also endorses poor sleep.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Weight is 257 pounds.  Pain scale is 7.,GENERAL:  This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination.  It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw.  She is obese.,HEENT:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally.  There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region.  There are no palpable cervical nodes.,NECK:  Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,HEART:  Heart sounds are distant.  There are no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:,MENTAL STATUS:  She is alert and oriented x3.  Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential.  She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.,MOTOR:  This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity.  There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout.  Her tone is normal throughout.,SENSORY:  She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg.  She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.,COORDINATION:  There is no obvious dysmetria.,GAIT:  She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker.  There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present.,REFLEXES:  Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent.  Toes are equivocal.,OTHER:  Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, "Oh my back, oh my back", and was unable to complete the maneuver.  Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology.  Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.,We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain.,PROCEDURES:,  C5-C6 and C6-C7 anterior cervical discectomy (two levels) C5-C6 and C6-C7 allograft fusions.  A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used.  Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy.  After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: , Symptomatic cholelithiasis.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Symptomatic cholelithiasis.,SERVICE: , Surgery.,CONSULTS:,  None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC is a 27-year-old woman who apparently presented with complaint of symptomatic cholelithiasis.  She was afebrile.  She was taken by Dr. X to the operating room.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient underwent a procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine.  She was afebrile.  She is tolerating liquid diet.  It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge.  She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs.  We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge.  I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain.  Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.  I feel that she looks good for discharge.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower.  She needs to keep her wound clean and dry.  She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks.  No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.  She must be able to stop in an emergency and be off narcotic meds, no strenuous activity, but she needs to maintain mobility.  She can resume her medications per med rec sheets.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: , As previously mentioned.,FOLLOWUP:,  We will follow up on both urinalysis and cultures.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks.  She needs to call for any shortness of breath, temperature greater than 101.5, chest pain, intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, any redness, swelling or foul smelling drainage from her wounds.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, This is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this.,He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was "rebuilt." He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair.,MEDICATIONS:, His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve. However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, "natural" potassium, Starlix and the aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week. He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, He has had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 years ago.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse was 88, respirations 18. He is afebrile.,MENTAL STATUS: He is alert.,CRANIAL NERVES: His pupils were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movements were full. The face was symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face. The tongue was midline.,NECK: His neck was supple.,MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC: His reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He was able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait. On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left.,CARDIOVASCULAR: He had no carotid bruits. His heart rhythm was regular.,BACK: There was no focal back pain present. He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly.,RADIOLOGIC DATA:, MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine. The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1. There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm. There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion. This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis.,LABORATORY: ,His initial labs were unremarkable.,IMPRESSION: ,Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology. Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion.,PLAN:, Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray. He will probably need a lumbar puncture. He also appears to have a mild peripheral neuropathy, which I suspect is an independent problem. We will request labs for this.
She has a past ocular history including cataract extraction with lens implants in both eyes in 2001 and 2003.  She also has a history of glaucoma diagnosed in 1990 and macular degeneration.  She has been followed in her home country and is here visiting family.  She had the above-mentioned observation and was brought in on an urgent basis today.,Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.,Her medications include V-optic 0.5% eye drops to both eyes twice a day and pilocarpine 2% OU three times a day.  She took both the drops this morning.  She also takes Eltroxin which is for hypothyroidism, Plendil for blood pressure, and pravastatin.,She is allergic to Cosopt.,She has a family history of blindness in her brother as well as glaucoma and hypertension.,Her visual acuity today at distance without correction are 20/25 in the right and count fingers at 3 feet in the left eye.  Manifest refraction showed no improvement in either eye.  The intraocular pressures by applanation were 7 on the right and 18 in the left eye.  Gonioscopy showed grade 4 open angles in both eyes.  Humphrey visual field testing done elsewhere showed diffuse reduction in sensitivity in both eyes.  The lids were normal OU.  She has mild dry eye OU.  The corneas are clear OU.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet OU.  Irides appear normal.  The lenses show well centered posterior chamber intraocular lenses OU.,Dilated fundus exam shows clear vitreous OU.  The optic nerves are normal in size.  They both appear to have mild pallor.  The optic cups in both eyes are shallow.  The cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye is not overtly large, would estimated 0.5 to 0.6; however, she does have very thin rim tissue inferotemporally in the right eye.  In the left eye, the glaucoma appears to be more advanced to the larger cup-to-disc ratio and a thinner rim tissue.,The macula on the right shows drusen with focal areas of RPE atrophy.  I do not see any evidence of neovascularization such as subretinal fluid, lipid or hemorrhage.  She does have a punctate area of RPE atrophy which is just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  In the left eye, she has also several high-risk drusen, but no evidence of neovascularization.  The RPE in the left eye does appear to be more diffusely abnormal although these changes do appear somewhat mild.  I do not see any dense or focal areas of frank RPE atrophy or hypertrophy.,The peripheral retinas are attached in both eyes.,Ms. ABC has pseudophakia OU which is stable and she is doing well in this regard.  She has glaucoma which likely is worse in the left eye and also likely explains her poor vision in the left eye.  The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teens in the left eye is probably high for her.  She has allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 months after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.,Regarding the macular degeneration, she has had high-risk changes in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she does have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  I strongly recommend that she see a retina specialist before returning to Israel in order to fully discuss prophylactic measures to prevent worsening of her macular degeneration in the right eye.
TESTICULAR ULTRASOUND,REASON FOR EXAM:  ,Left testicular swelling for one day.,FINDINGS:  ,The left testicle is normal in size and attenuation, it measures 3.2 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm.  The right epididymis measures up to 9 mm.  There is a hydrocele on the right side.  Normal flow is seen within the testicle and epididymis on the right.,The left testicle is normal in size and attenuation, it measures 3.9 x 2.1 x 2.6 cm.  The left testicle shows normal blood flow.  The left epididymis measures up to 9 mm and shows a markedly increased vascular flow.  There is mild scrotal wall thickening.  A hydrocele is seen on the left side.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Hypervascularity of the left epididymis compatible with left epididymitis.,2.  Bilateral hydroceles.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Suspected mastoiditis ruled out.,2.  Right acute otitis media.,3.  Severe ear pain resolving.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 11-year-old male who was admitted from the ER after a CT scan suggested that the child had mastoiditis.  The child has had very severe ear pain and blood draining from the right ear.  The child had a temperature maximum of 101.4 in the ER.  The patient was admitted and started on IV Unasyn, which he tolerated well and required Morphine and Vicodin for pain control.  In the first 12 hours after admission, the patient's pain decreased and also swelling of his cervical area decreased.  The patient was evaluated by Dr. X from the ENT while in house.  After reviewing the CT scan, it was felt that the CT scan was not consistent with mastoiditis.  The child was continued on IV fluid and narcotics for pain as well as Unasyn until the time of discharge.  At the time of discharge his pain is markedly decreased about 2/10 and swelling in the area has improved.  The patient is also able to take p.o. well.,DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is alert, in no respiratory distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  His temperature is 97.6, heart rate 83, blood pressure 105/57, respiratory rate 16 on room air.,HEENT:  Right ear shows no redness.  The area behind his ear is nontender.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Fractured and retained lumbar subarachnoid spinal catheter.,2.  Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension).,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  L1 laminotomy.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  Retrieval of foreign body (retained lumbar spinal catheter).,4.  Attempted insertion of new external lumbar drain.,5.  Fluoroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,The patient had a lumbar subarachnoid drain placed yesterday.  All went well with the surgery.  The catheter stopped draining and on pulling back the catheter, it fractured and CT scan showed that the remaining fragment is deep to the lamina.  The patient continues to have right eye blindness and headaches, presumably from the pseudotumor cerebri.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the operating room table resting on chest rolls.  Her face was resting in a pink foam headrest.  Extreme care was taken positioning her because she weighs 92 kg.  There was a lot of extra padding for her limbs and her limbs were positioned comfortably.  The arms were not hyperextended.  Great care was taken with positioning of the head and making sure there was no pressure on her eyes especially since she already has visual disturbance.  A Foley catheter was in place.  She received IV Cipro 400 mg because she is allergic to most antibiotics.,Fluoroscopy was used to locate the lower end of the fractured catheter and the skin was marked.  It was also marked where we would try to insert the new catheter at the L4 or L3 interspinous space.,The patient was then prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A 7-cm incision was made over the L1 lamina.  The incision was carried down through the fascia all the way down to the spinous processes.  A self-retaining McCullough retractor was placed.  The laminae were quite deep.  The microscope was brought in and using the Midas Rex drill with the AM-8 bit and removing some of the spinous process of L1-L2 with double-action rongeurs, the laminotomy was then done using the drill and great care was taken and using a 2-mm rongeur, the last layer of lamina was removed exposing the epidural fat and dura.  The opening in the bone was 1.5 x 1.5 cm.,Occasionally, bipolar cautery was used for bleeding of epidural veins, but this cautery was kept to a minimum.,Under high magnification, the dura was opened with an 11 blade and microscissors.  At first, there was a linear incision vertically to the left of midline, and I then needed to make a horizontal incision more towards the right.  The upper aspect of the cauda equina was visualized and perhaps the lower end of the conus.  Microdissection under high magnification did not expose the catheter.  The fluoroscope was brought in 2 more times including getting a lateral view and the fluoroscope appeared to show that the catheter should be in this location.,I persisted with intensive microdissection and finally we could see the catheter deep to the nerves and I was able to pull it out with the microforceps.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,At this point, I then attempted lumbar puncture by making a small incision with an 11 blade in the L4 interspinous space and then later in the L3 interspinous space and attempted to puncture the dural sac with the Tuohy needle.  Dr. Y also tried.  Despite using the fluoroscope and our best attempts, we were not able to convincingly puncture the lumbar subarachnoid space and so the attempted placement of the new lumbar catheter had to be abandoned.  It will be done at a later date.,I felt it was unsafe to place a new catheter at this existing laminotomy site because it was very high up near the conus.  The potential for complications involving her spinal cord was greater and we have already had a complication of the catheter now and I just did not think it was safe to put in this location.,Under high magnification, the dura was closed with #6-0 PDS interrupted sutures.,After the dura was closed, a piece of Gelfoam was placed over the dura.  The paraspinous muscles were closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  The subcutaneous fascia was also closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted suture.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and the skin with #4-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The 4-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures were also used at the lumbar puncture sites to close the skin.,The patient was then turned carefully on to her bed after sterile dressings were applied and then taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts correct.  Blood loss minimal, none replaced.  This procedure took 5 hours.  This case was also extremely difficult due to patient's size and the difficulty of locating the catheter deep to the cauda equina.
EXAM: , Ultrasound of pelvis.,HISTORY:, Menorrhagia.,FINDINGS: , Uterus is enlarged measuring 11.0 x 7.5 x 11.0 cm.  It appears to be completely replaced by multiple ill-defined fibroids.  The endometrial echo complex was not visualized due to the contents of replacement of the uterus with fibroids.  The right ovary measures 3.9 x 1.9 x 2.3 cm.  The left ovary is not seen.  No complex cystic adnexal masses are identified.,IMPRESSION:  ,Essential replacement of the uterus by fibroids.  It is difficult to measure given their heterogenous and diffuse nature.  MRI of the pelvis could be performed for further evaluation to evaluate for possible uterine fibroid embolization.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Lipodystrophy of the abdomen and thighs.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Lipodystrophy of the abdomen and thighs.,OPERATION: , Suction-assisted lipectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire abdomen, flanks, perineum, and thighs to the knees were prepped and draped circumferentially in sterile fashion.  After this had been completed, a #15 blade was used to make small stab wounds in the lateral hips, the pubic area, and upper edge of the umbilicus.  Through these small incisions, a cannula was used to infiltrate lactated Ringers with 1000 cc was infiltrated initially into the abdomen.  A 3 and 4-mm cannulas were then used to carry out the liposuction of the abdomen removing a total of 1100 cc of aspirate, which was mostly fat, little fluid, and blood.  Attention was then directed to the thighs both inner and outer.  A total of 1000 cc was infiltrated in both lateral thighs only about 50 cc in the medial thighs.  After this had been completed, 3 and 4-mm cannulas were used to suction 650 cc from each side, approximately 50 cc in the inner thigh and 600 on each lateral thigh.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  All of this aspirate was mostly fat with little fluid and very little blood.  Wounds were cleaned and steri-stripped and dressing of ABD pads and ***** was then applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left mesothelioma, focal.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left pleural-based nodule.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Left thoracoscopy.,2.  Left mini thoracotomy with resection of left pleural-based mass.,FINDINGS:,  Left anterior pleural-based nodule, which was on a thin pleural pedicle with no invasion into the chest wall.,FLUIDS: , 800 mL of crystalloid.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,DRAINS, TUBES, CATHETERS: , 24-French chest tube in the left thorax plus Foley catheter.,SPECIMENS: , Left pleural-based nodule.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 59-year-old female with previous history of follicular thyroid cancer, approximately 40 years ago, status post resection with recurrence in the 1980s, who had a left pleural-based mass identified on chest x-ray.  Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.,Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.,Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.,At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Extensive perianal and intra-anal condyloma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Extensive perianal and intra-anal condyloma.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Cauterization of peri and intra-anal condylomas.,ANESTHESIA:  ,IV sedation and local.,SPECIMEN: , Multiple condylomas were sent to pathology.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 10 cc.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 22-year-old female, who presented to the office complaining of condylomas she had noted in her anal region.  She has noticed approximately three to four weeks ago.  She denies any pain but does state that there is some itching.  No other symptoms associated.,GROSS FINDINGS: , We found multiple extensive perianal and intra-anal condylomas, which are likely represent condyloma acuminata.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits and complications were explained to the patient and a verbal consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  After the area was prepped and draped, a local anesthesia was achieved with Marcaine.  Bovie electrocautery was then used to remove the condylomas taking care to achieve meticulous hemostasis throughout the course of the procedure.  The condylomas were removed 350 degrees from the perianal and intra-anal regions.  After all visible condylomas were removed, the area was again washed with acetic acid solution.  Any residual condylomas were then cauterized at this time.  The area was then examined again for any residual bleeding and there was none.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was taken to Recovery in stable condition.  She will be sent home with prescriptions for a topical lidocaine and Vicodin.  She will be instructed to do sitz bath b.i.d., and post-bowel movement.  She will follow up in the office next week.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Umbilical hernia repair.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table.  The patient was sedated, and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard curvilinear umbilical incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the hernia sac using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The sac was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the fascial defect was delineated.  The fascia was cleared of any adherent tissue for a distance of 1.5 cm from the defect.  The sac was then placed into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed primarily using simple interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The umbilicus was then re-formed using 4-0 Vicryl to tack the umbilical skin to the fascia.,The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The skin was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Laryngeal edema.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Laryngeal edema.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Tracheostomy change.  A #6 Shiley with proximal extension was changed to a #6 Shiley with proximal extension.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital with exacerbation of COPD and CHF.  The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left inguinal hernia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left inguinal hernia.,ANESTHESIA:,  General; 0.25% Marcaine at trocar sites.,NAME OF OPERATION:,  Laparoscopic left inguinal hernia repair.,PROCEDURE: , A skin incision was placed at the umbilicus where the left rectus fascia was incised anteriorly.  The rectus muscle was retracted laterally.  Balloon dissector was passed below the muscle and above the peritoneum.  Insufflation and deinsufflation were done with the balloon removed.  The structural balloon was placed in the preperitoneal space and insufflated to 10 mmHg carbon dioxide.  The other trocars were placed in the lower midline times two.  The hernia sac was easily identified and was well defined.  It was dissected off the cord anteromedially.  It was an indirect sac.  It was taken back down and reduced into the peritoneal cavity.  Mesh was then tailored and placed overlying the defect, covering the femoral, indirect, and direct spaces, tacked into place.  After this was completed, there was good hemostasis.  The cord, structures, and vas were left intact.  The trocars were removed.  The wounds were closed with 0 Vicryl for the fascia, 4-0 for the skin.  Steri-Strips were applied.  The patient was awakened and carried to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Visually significant posterior capsule opacity, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Visually significant posterior capsule opacity, right eye.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURES:  ,YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, right eye.,ANESTHESIA: , Topical anesthesia using tetracaine ophthalmic drops.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: , This patient was found to have a visually significant posterior capsule opacity in the right eye.  The patient has had a mild decrease in visual acuity, which has been a gradual change.  The posterior capsule opacity was felt to be related to the decline in vision.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives (including observation) were discussed.  I feel the patient had a good understanding of the proposed procedure and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  Pupil was dilated per protocol.  Patient was positioned at the YAG laser.  Then, *** of energy were used to perform a circular posterior laser capsulotomy through the visual axis.  A total of ** shots were used.  Total energy was **.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.  The lens remained well centered and stable.  Postoperative instructions were provided.  Alphagan P ophthalmic drops times two were instilled prior to his dismissal.,Post-laser intraocular pressure measured ** mmHg.  Postoperative instructions were provided and the patient had no further questions.
PROBLEM:  ,Prescription evaluation for Crohn's disease., ,HISTORY: , This is a 46-year-old male who is here for a refill of Imuran.  He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,He had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,Earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  , ,He also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.  He associates the onset of his symptoms with eating spicy Mexican food., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Reviewed and unchanged.,ALLERGIES: , No known allergies to medications.,OPERATIONS: , Unchanged.,ILLNESSES: , Crohn's disease, vitamin B12 deficiency.,MEDICATIONS:,  Imuran, Nascobal, Vicodin p.r.n., ,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Dated 08/04/04 is reviewed and noted.  Please see pertinent GI issues as discussed above.  Otherwise unremarkable., ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  , GENERAL:  Pleasant male in no acute distress.  Well nourished and well developed. SKIN: indurated, cord-like superficial vein on the right anterior forearm, approx. 3 cm in length.  Non-tender to palpation. No erythema or red streaking.  No edema. LYMPH:  No epitrochlear or axillary lymph node enlargement or tenderness on the right side. , ,DATA REVIEWED: Labs from June 8th and July 19th reviewed.  Liver function tests normal with AST 14 and ALT 44.  WBCs were slightly low at 4.8.  Hemoglobin dropped slightly from 14.1 on 6/8 to 12.9 on 7/19. Hematocrit dropped slightly as well from 43.2 on 6/804 to 40.0 on 7/19/04.  These results were reviewed by Dr. S and lab results letter sent., ,IMPRESSION:  ,1. Crohn's disease, status post terminal ileum resection, on Imuran.  Intermittent symptoms of bowel obstruction.  Last episode three weeks ago.,2.  History of non-specific hepatitis while taking high doses of Tylenol.  Now resolved. ,2.  Increased frequency of reflux symptoms.,3.  Superficial thrombophlebitis, resolving. ,4.  Slightly low H&H., ,PLAN:  ,1.  We discussed Dr. S's recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms.  The patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  The patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  He states understanding of this. Advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. ,2.  Continue with liver panel and ABC every month per Dr. S's instructions.,3.  Continue Imuran 100 mg per day.,4.  Continue to minimize Tylenol use.  The patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not Tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  Dr. S is consulted and agrees that Imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. The patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. ,5.  Reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  Encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter H2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  The patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for Zantac 150 mg per day will be provided.  Reviewed the potential need for upper endoscopy should his symptoms continue or become more frequent.  He does not want to undergo any type of procedure such as that at this time.,6.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot.,2.  Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot.,2.  Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,Local infiltrate with IV sedation.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems.  The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.  The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0).,2.  Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2).,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0).,2.  Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2).,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,1.  Left carpal tunnel release (64721).,2.  Left ulnar nerve anterior submuscular transposition at the elbow (64718).,3.  Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280).,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia with intubation.,INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic.  He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis.  Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation.  He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity.  However, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger.  These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts.  Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger.  Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger.  Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary.  Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of "ping-pong ball sign" due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers.  However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time.,The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks.  Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve.  This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef.  The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion.  A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm.  The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease.  Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal.  I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm.  Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel.  The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so.  There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression.  The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified.  The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures.,I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle.  Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass.  In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap.  I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve.,I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm.  The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised.  The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures.  Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips.  I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers.  The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques.  In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner.,I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner.  Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other.  So that in effect a lengthening is performed.  Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures.  I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve.  The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis.  Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound.  A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist.  Fingers and femoral were free to move.  The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage.  Meanwhile the patient is awakened and extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in good condition.  Sponge and needle counts reported as correct at the end of the procedure.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right axillary adenopathy.,2.  Thrombocytopenia.,3.  Hepatosplenomegaly.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right axillary adenopathy.,2.  Thrombocytopenia.,3.  Hepatosplenomegaly.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Right axillary lymph node biopsy.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with sedation.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital secondary to hiccups and was ultimately found to have a right axillary mass to be severely thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 2000 as well as having hepatosplenomegaly.  The working diagnosis is lymphoma, however, the Hematology and Oncology Departments were requesting a lymph node biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis as well as prognosis.  Thus, the patient was scheduled for a lymph node biopsy with platelets running secondary to thrombocytopenia at the time of surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a large right axillary lymphadenopathy, one of the lymph node was sent down as a fresh specimen.,PROCEDURE:  ,After informed written consent, risks and benefits of this procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  Multiple lymph nodes were palpated in the right axilla, however, the most inferior node was to be removed.  First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine solution.  Next, using a #15 blade scalpel, an incision was made approximately 4 cm in length transversally in the inferior axilla.  Next, using electro Bovie cautery, maintaining hemostasis, dissection was carried down to the lymph node.  The lymph node was then completely excised using electro Bovie cautery as well as hemostats to maintain hemostasis and then lymph node was sent to specimen fresh to the lab.  Several hemostats were used, suture ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture and hemostasis was maintained.  Next the deep dermal layers were approximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  After the wound has been copiously irrigated, the skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture and the pathology is pending.  The patient did tolerated the procedure well.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to the Recovery in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left facial cellulitis.,2.  Possible odontogenic abscess of the #18, #19, and #20.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Left facial cellulitis.,2.

The attempted FNA was without any purulent aspirate although limited in the area of attempted examination.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 39-year-old Caucasian female who was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 08/21/03 secondary to acute left facial cellulitis suspected to be secondary to odontogenic etiology.  The patient states that this was started approximately 24 hours ago.  The patient subsequently presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room secondary to worsening of left face swelling and increasing in pain.  The patient admits to poor dental hygiene.  Denies any recent or dental abscesses in the past.  The patient is a substance abuser, does admit to smoking cocaine approximately three days ago.  The patient did have a CT scan of the face obtained with contrast demonstrated no signs of any acute abscess although a profuse amount of cellulitis was noted.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were discussed with the patient, a written consent was obtained for an I&D of a possible odontogenic abscess ________ on the CT scan.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought in upright and supine position.  Approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was injected in the localized area along the buccogingival sulcus of the left side.  This was done at the base of #18, #19, and #20 teeth.  After this, the patient did have approximately 2 more mg of morphine given through the IV for pain control.  After this, the #18 gauge needle on a ________ syringe was then utilized to attempt a FNA at the base of #18 tooth and #19 with one stick placed.  There were no signs of any purulent drainage, although at this time the patient became very irate and noncompliant and refusing further examination.  The patient understood consequences of her actions.  Does state that she does not care at this time and just wants to be left alone.  At this time, the bed was actually placed back in its normal position and the patient will be continued on clindamycin 900 mg IV q.6h. along with pain control utilizing Toradol, morphine, and Vicodin.  The patient will also be started on Peridex oral rinse of 10 cc p.o. swish and spit t.i.d. and a K-pad to the left face.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  T11 compression fracture with intractable pain.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  T11 compression fracture with intractable pain.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Unilateral transpedicular T11 vertebroplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local with IV sedation.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,SUMMARY: , The patient in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Using AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections the T11 compression fracture was identified.  Starting from the left side local anesthetic was used for skin wheal just lateral superior to the 10 o'clock position of the lateral aspect of the T11 pedicle on the left.  The 13-gauge needle and trocar were then taken and placed to 10 o'clock position on the pedicle.  At this point using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle and trocar were advanced into the vertebral body using the fluoroscopic images and making sure that the needle was lateral to the medial wall of the pedicle of the pedicle at all times.  Once the vertebral body was entered then using lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle was advanced to the junction of the anterior one third and posterior two thirds of the body.  At this point polymethylmethacrylate was mixed for 60 seconds.  Once the consistency had hardened and the __________ was gone, incremental dose of the cement were injected into the vertebral body.  It was immediately seen that the cement was going cephalad into the vertebral body and was exiting through the crack in the vertebra.  A total 1.2 cc of cement was injected.  On lateral view, the cement crushed to the right side as well.  There was some dye infiltration into the disk space.  There was no dye taken whatsoever into the posterior aspect of the epidural space or intrathecal canal.,At this point, as the needle was slowly withdrawn under lateral fluoroscopic images, visualization was maintained to ensure that none of the cement was withdrawn posteriorly into the epidural space.  Once the needle was withdrawn safely pressure was held over the site for three minutes.  There were no complications.  The patient was taken back to the recovery area in stable condition and kept flat for one hour.  Should be followed up the next morning.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Worrisome skin lesion, left hand.,POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Worrisome skin lesion, left hand.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient gave informed consent for his procedure.  After informed consent was obtained, attention was turned toward the area of interest, which was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,Local anesthetic medication was infiltrated around and into the area of interest.  There was an obvious skin lesion there and this gentleman has a history of squamous cell carcinoma.  A punch biopsy of the worrisome skin lesion was obtained with a portion of the normal tissue included.  The predominant portion of the biopsy was of the lesion itself.,Lesion was removed.  Attention was turned toward the area.  Pressure was held and the area was hemostatic.,The skin and the area were closed with 5-0 nylon suture.  All counts were correct.  The procedure was closed.  A sterile dressing was applied.  There were no complications.  The patient had no neurovascular deficits, etc., after this minor punch biopsy procedure.,
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Selective ascending aortic arch angiogram.,2.  Selective left common carotid artery angiogram.,3.  Selective right common carotid artery angiogram.,4.  Selective left subclavian artery angiogram.,5.  Right iliac angio with runoff.,6.  Bilateral cerebral angiograms were performed as well via right and left common carotid artery injections.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , TIA, aortic stenosis, postoperative procedure.  Moderate carotid artery stenosis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  400 ml.,SPECIMENS REMOVED:,  Not applicable.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French sheath was placed into the right common femoral artery and vein without complication.  Using injection through the side port of the sheath, a right iliac angiogram with runoff was performed.  Following this, straight pigtail catheter was used to advance the aortic arch and aortic arch angiogram under digital subtraction was performed.  Following this, selective engagement in left common carotid artery, right common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery angiograms were performed with a V-Tech catheter over an 0.035-inch wire.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,1.  Type 2 aortic arch.,2.  Left subclavian artery was patent.,3 Left vertebral artery was patent.,4.  Left internal carotid artery had a 40% to 50% lesion with ulceration, not treated and there was no cerebral cross over.,5.  Right common carotid artery had a 60% to 70% lesion which was heavily calcified and was not treated with the summed left-to-right cross over flow.,6.  Closure was with a 6-French Angio-Seal of the artery, and the venous sheath was sutured in.,PLAN:,  Continue aspirin, Plavix, and Coumadin to an INR of 2 with a carotid duplex followup.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,OPERATION:,  Cysto stent removal.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local MAC.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose.  The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Cystoscopy.,2.  Bladder biopsy with fulguration.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with local.,SPECIMEN: , Urine cytology and right lateral wall biopsies.,PROCEDURE:,  After the consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and given IV sedation.  He was then placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then used to visualized the entire urethra and bladder.  There was noted to be a narrowing of the proximal urethra, however, the scope was able to pass through.  The patient was noted to have a previously resected prostate.  On visualization of the bladder, the patient did have areas of erythema on the right as well as the left lateral walls, more significant on the right side.  The patient did have increased vascularity throughout the bladder.  The ________ two biopsies of the right lateral wall and those were sent for pathology.  The Bovie cautery was then used to cauterize the entire area of the biopsy as well as surrounding erythema.  Bovie was also utilized to cauterize the areas of erythema on the left lateral wall.  No further bleeding was identified.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room.,He will have his defibrillator restarted and will followup with Dr. X in approximately two weeks for the result.  He will be discharged home with antibiotics as well as pain medications.  He is to restart his Coumadin not before Sunday.

PRESENTATION: , A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with rectal bleeding and pain on defecation.,HISTORY:,  A 16-year-old African American male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and pain on defecation.  The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating.  The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool.  The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge.  The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain.  He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative.  The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week.  He states that he had felt "feverish" on several occasions but has not taken his temperature.  He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue.  He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss.,The patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13.  He admits to eight previous partners and states that he "usually" uses a condom.  On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male.  His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months.  He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing.  He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy.  The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family.  As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life.  He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men.  He is accessing care in the ED unaccompanied by an adult.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Thin but non-toxic young man with clear discomfort.,Pulse = 105,RR = 23,BP = 120/62,HEENT:  Several areas of white plaque-like material on the buccal mucosa.,Neck:  Multiple anterior/posterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains- 1-2 cm in diameter.,Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.,Cardiac:  Quiet precordium.,Nl S1/S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur. ,Abdomen:  Soft without hepatosplenomegaly.,GU:  Tanner V male with no external penile lesions.,Lymph:  2-3 cm axillary nodes bilaterally.,1-2 cm epitrochlear nodes.,Multiple 1-2 cm inguinal nodes.,Rectal:  Extremely painful digital exam.,+ gross blood and mucous.,LABORATORY EVALUATION:,Hbg = 12.  5 gm/dL,Hct = 32%,WBC = 3.9 thou/µL,Platelets = 120,000 thou/µL,76% neutrophils,19% lymphocytes,1% eosinophils,4% monocytes,ALT = 82 U/L,AST= 90 U/L,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate = 90,Electrolytes = normal,Gram stain of anal swab:  numerous WBCs,DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: , This patient is presenting with acute rectal pain with bleeding and anal discharge.  The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination.  The following are in the differential diagnosis:  Acute Proctitis and  Proctocolitis.,ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: , This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use.  Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion.  The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required.,PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: , A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD.  The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient.  However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema.,DIAGNOSIS:  ,The subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR.,DISCUSSION: , This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult.  First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider.  Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed.  Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners.  As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors.  Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions.  Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors.  Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections.  If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs.  Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms.  As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation.  In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered.  The care provided to this young man included the following.  He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis.  Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae.  At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program.  The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support.  The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later.  Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection.,Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% ,Quantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mL
PROCEDURE:, Placement of Scott cannula, right lateral ventricle.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The right side of the head was shaved and the area was then prepped using Betadine prep. Following an injection with Xylocaine with epinephrine, a small 1.5 cm linear incision was made paralleling the midline, lateral to the midline, at the region of the coronal suture. A twist drill was made with the hand drill through the dura. A Scott cannula was placed on the first pass into the right lateral ventricle with egress initially of bloody and the clear CSF. The Scott cannula was secured to the skin using 3-0 silk sutures. This will be connected to external drainage set at 10 cm of water.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bradycardia.,2.  Dizziness.,3.  Diabetes.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Abdominal pain.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Sick sinus syndrome.

Afterwards, elliptical incisions were placed with a #15-blade scalpel and curved iris scissors and small bishop forceps were used for the dissection of the skin lesions.  After all were removed, they were closed with one-layer technique for the shoulder and medial lesion, and the larger left chest lesion was closed with two-layer closure using Monocryl 5-0 for subcuticular closure and 5-0 nylon for skin closure.  She tolerated this procedure very well, and postoperative care instructions were provided.  She will follow up next week for suture removal.  Of note, she had an episode of hemoptysis, which could not be explained prompting an emergency room visit, and I discussed if this continues we may wish to perform a fiberoptic laryngoscopy examination and possible further workup if a diagnosis cannot be made.
REASON FOR ADMISSION: , Cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: , Cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis.,ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES,1.  Status post roux-en-y gastric bypass converted to an open procedure in 01/07.,2.  Laparoscopic paraventral hernia in 11/07.,3.  History of sleep apnea with reversal after 100-pound weight loss.,4.  Morbid obesity with bmi of 39.4.,PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE:,  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopy converted to open common bile duct exploration and stone extraction.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 33-year-old female admitted with elevated bilirubin and probable common bile duct stone.  She was admitted through the emergency room with abdominal pain, elevated bilirubin, and gallstones on ultrasound with a dilated common bile duct.  She subsequently went for a HIDA scan to rule out cholecystitis.  Gallbladder was filled but was unable to empty into the small bowel consistent with the common bile duct blockage.  She was taken to the operating room that night for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  We proceeded with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and during the cholangiogram there was no contrast.  It was able to be extravasated into the duodenum with the filling defect consistent with the distal common bile duct stone.  The patient had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but could not receive an ERCP and stone extraction, therefore, common bile duct exploration was performed and a stone was extracted.  This necessitated conversion to an open operation.  She was transferred to the medical surgical unit postoperatively.  She had a significant amount of incisional pain following morning, but no nausea.  A Jackson-Pratt drain, which was left in place in two places showed serosanguineous fluid.  White blood cell count was down to 7500 and bilirubin decreased to 2.1.  Next morning she was started on a liquid diet.  Foley catheter was discontinued.  There was no evidence of bile leak from the drains.  She was advanced to a regular diet on postoperative day #3, which was 12/09/07.  The following morning she was tolerating regular diet.  Her bowels had begun to function, and she was afebrile with her pain control with oral pain medications.  Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued from the wound.  The remaining Jackson-Pratt drain was left adjacent to her cystic duct.  Following morning, her laboratory studies were better.  Her bilirubin was down to normal and white blood cell count was normal with an H&H of 9 and 26.3.  Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued, and she was discharged home.  Followup was in 3 days for staple removal.  She was given iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lortab elixir 15 cc p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. for pain.

Biceps tenotomy, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATION: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under interscalene block anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 61-year-old white male who is dominantly right-handed.  He had increasing right shoulder pain and dysfunction for a number of years prior to surgical intervention.  This was gradually done over a period of time.  No specific accident or injury could be seen or pointed.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  After discussing alternatives of the care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Preoperatively, the patient did not have limitation of motion.  He had gross weakness to his supraspinatus, mildly to the infraspinatus and subscapularis upon strength testing prior to his anesthetic.,Intraarticularly, the patient had an 80% biceps tendon tear that was dislocated.  His rotator interval was resolved as well as his subscapularis with tearing.  The supraspinatus was completely torn, retracted back beyond the level of the labrum and approximately one-third or so of the infraspinatus was involved with the remaining portion being greatly thinned as far as we could observe.  Glenoid labrum had degenerative tear in the inferior surface.  Gross chondromalacia was present to approximately 50% of the humeral head and approximately the upper 40% of the glenoid surface.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department, he was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created outside the end posteriorly and then anteriorly.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out with the above-noted findings.  The shaver was placed anteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum tear and the last 20% of the biceps tendon tear was completed.  Debridement was carried out to the end or attachment of the bicep itself.,Debridement was carried out to what could be seen of the remaining rotator cuff there, but then the scope was redirected in a subacromial direction and gross bursectomy carried out.  Debridement was then carried out to the rotator cuff remaining tendon near the tuberosity.  No osteophytes were present.  Because of the massive nature of the tear, the CA ligament was maintained and there were no substantial changes to the subacromial region to necessitate burring.  There was concern because of instability that could be present at the end of this.,Another portal was created laterally to do all of this.  We did what we could to mobilize all sections of the rotator cuff, superiorly, posteriorly, and anteriorly.  We took this back to the level of coracoid base.  We released the coracohumeral ligament basically all but there was no excursion basically all to the portion of the rotator cuff torn.  Because of this, further debridement was carried out.  Debridement had been previously carried out to the humeral head as well as glenoid surface to debride the chondromalacia and take this down to the smooth edge.  Care was taken to not to debride deeper than that.  This was done prior to the above.,All instrumentation was removed.  A Pain-Buster catheter was placed into a separate anterolateral portal cut to length.  Interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closures.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, Elastoplast tape were placed for a compression dressing.,The patient's arm was placed in an arm sling.  He was transferred to his cart and to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is quite guarded because of the above-noted pathology.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right common, internal and external carotid artery stenosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right common, internal and external carotid artery stenosis.,OPERATIONS,1.  Right common carotid endarterectomy.,2.  Right internal carotid endarterectomy.,3.  Right external carotid endarterectomy.,4.  Hemashield patch angioplasty of the right common, internal and external carotid arteries.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,URINE OUTPUT: , Not recorded,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next the right neck was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make an incision at the anterior tip of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the carotid artery using Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors.  The common, internal and external carotid arteries were identified.  The facial vein was ligated with #3-0 silk.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and preserved as it coursed across the carotid artery.  After dissecting out an adequate length of common, internal and external carotid artery, heparin was given.  Next, an umbilical tape was passed around the common carotid artery.  A #0 silk suture was passed around the internal and external carotid arteries.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and preserved.  An appropriate sized Argyle shunt was chosen.  A Hemashield patch was cut to the appropriate size.  Next, vascular clamps were placed on the external carotid artery.  DeBakey pickups were used to control the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an incision on the common carotid artery.  The arteriotomy was lengthened onto the internal carotid artery.  Next, the Argyle shunt was placed.  It was secured in place.  Next, an endarterectomy was performed; and this was done on the common, internal carotid and external carotid arteries.  An inversion technique was used on the external carotid artery.  The artery was irrigated and free debris was removed.  Next, we sewed the Hemashield patch onto the artery using #6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Prior to completion of our anastomosis, we removed our shunt.  We completed the anastomosis.  Next, we removed our clamp from the external carotid artery, followed by the common carotid artery, and lastly by the internal carotid artery.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Full-dose protamine was given.  The incision was closed with #0 Vicryl, followed by #2-0 Vicryl, followed by #4-0 PDS in a running subcuticular fashion.  A sterile dressing was applied.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Acute renal failure.,HISTORY: , Limited data is available; I have reviewed his admission notes. Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly. A suggestion of hypertensive disease versus BPH, he was on terazosin. Suggestion of CHF versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with Lasix. He was iron, I presume for anemia. He was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, OTHER PHYSICIAN'S NOTES INDICATE NO KNOWN ALLERGIES.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Not available.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Not available.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Not available.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: An older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.,HEENT: Male pattern baldness. Pupils equally round, no icterus. Intubated. OG tube in place.,NECK: Not tested for suppleness, no carotid bruits are heard. Neck vein distention is not seen.,LUNGS: He has diffuse expiratory wheezing anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly. I would describe the wheezes as coarse. I hear no present rales. Breath sounds otherwise are symmetrical.,HEART: Heart tones regular to auscultation, currently without audible rub or gallop sounds.,BREASTS: Not enlarged.,ABDOMEN: On plane. Bowel sounds presently are normal. Abdomen, I believe, is soft on plane, normal bowel sounds, no bruits, no liver edge felt, no HJR, no spleen tip, no suprapubic fullness.,GU: Catheter draining a dark yellow urine.,EXTREMITIES: Very edematous. Pulses not palpable. Cyanosis not observed. Fungal changes are not observed.,NEUROLOGICAL: Not otherwise assessed.,LABORATORY DATA:, Reviewed.,IMPRESSION:,1. Acute renal failure, suspected. Likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. He also reportedly was on Lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.,2. Multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.,3. I am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum CK recorded is 1500.,4. Antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.,5. Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. Recorded I's are substantially O's during the course of the hospitalization, I presume as part of his resuscitation effort. No central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available. I will follow with you. No present indication for hemodialysis. Antimicrobials are being handled by others.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Resection of infected bone, left hallux, proximal phalanx, and distal phalanx.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/Local.,HISTORY:,  This 77-year-old male presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping himself NPO since mid night for surgery on his infected left hallux.  The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a "floppy tail" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.  He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home.  The patient was discharged in stable condition.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hydrocele.,OPERATION: , Left hydrocelectomy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hydrocele.,ANESTHESIA: , General,INDICATIONS AND STUDIES: , This is a 67-year-old male with pain, left scrotum.  He has had an elevated PSA and also has erectile dysfunction.  He comes in now for a left hydrocelectomy.  Physical exam confirmed obvious hydrocele, left scrotum, approximately 8 cm.  Laboratory data included a hematocrit of 43.5, hemoglobin of 15.0, and white count 4700.  Creatinine 1.3, sodium 141, and potassium 4.0.  Calcium 8.6.  Chest x-ray was unremarkable.  EKG was normal.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia, prepped and draped in supine position, and left scrotal incision was made, carried down to the tunica vaginalis forming the hydrocele.  This was dissected free from the scrotal wall back to the base of the testicle and then excised back to the spermatic cord.  In the fashion, the hydrocele was excised and fluid drained.,Cord was infiltrated with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  The edges of the tunica vaginalis adjacent to the spermatic cord were oversewn with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures for hemostasis.  The left testicle was replaced into the left scrotal compartment and affixed to the overlying Dartos fascia with a 3-0 Vicryl suture through the edge of the tunica vaginalis and the overlying Dartos fascia.,The left scrotal incision was closed, first closing the Dartos fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin was closed with an interrupted running 4-0 chromic suture.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, upon awakening from general anesthesia.  Plan is to discharge the patient and see him back in the office in a week or 2 in followup.  Further plans will depend upon how he does.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus deformity, right foot.,2.  Tailor bunion deformity, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux abductovalgus deformity, right foot.,2.  Tailor bunion deformity, right foot.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  ,Tailor bunionectomy, right foot, Weil-type with screw fixation.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with MAC, local consisting of 20 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain.,HEMOSTASIS:,  Pneumatic ankle tourniquet at 200 mmHg.,INJECTABLES:,  A 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate.,MATERIAL: , A 2.4 x 14 mm, 2.4 x 16 mm, and 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw.  A 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 nylon.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the usual supine position.  At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot.  The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well.  Dr. A was present throughout the entire case.

The patient was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol.  The patient was positioned lying supine.  Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine.  The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 7 mL was injected on the right side and 5 mL on the left side.  At all sites of phenol injections in this area injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.  The musculocutaneous nerve was identified in the left upper extremity above the brachial pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 5 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location.  Injections in this area were done at the site of maximum elbow flexion contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.,Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 150 units was injected in the knee extensors bilaterally, 100 units in the left pectoralis major, and 50 units in the left wrist flexors.  Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.

The right eardrum is intact showing a successful tympanoplasty.  I cleaned a little wax from the external meatus.  The right eardrum might be very slightly red but not obviously infected.  The left eardrum (not the surgical ear) has a definite infection with a reddened bulging drum but no perforation or granulation tissue.  Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide.  The patient has no medical allergies.  Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens.  I looked at this throat which looks clear.  The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions.  If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops.  I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection.  I plan to see the patient again later this spring.

REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt "just like the stroke."  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing "mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter," but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it "every other night."  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times "snoring" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only "comes and goes.",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Acute appendicitis.,2.  29-week pregnancy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Acute appendicitis.,2.  29-week pregnancy.,OPERATION: , Appendectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,After obtaining the informed consent including all risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was urgently taken to the operating room where a spinal anesthetic was given and the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in a usual fashion.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  A time-out process was followed.  Local anesthetics were infiltrated in the area of the proposed incision.  A modified McBurney incision was performed.  A very abnormal appendix was immediately found.  There was a milky fluid around the area and this was cultured both for aerobic and anaerobic cultures.  The distal end of the appendix had transformed itself into an abscess.  The proximal portion was normal.  The appendix was very friable and a no-touch technique was used.  It was carefully dissected off the cecum, and then it was ligated and excised after the mesoappendix had been taken care of.  Then the stump was buried with a pursestring of 2-0 Vicryl.  The operative area was abundantly irrigated with warm saline and then closed in layers.  The layer was further irrigated.  A subcuticular suture of Monocryl was performed in the skin followed by the application of Dermabond.,Further local anesthetic was infiltrated at the end of the procedure in the operative area and the patient tolerated the procedure well, and with an estimated blood loss that was not consequential, was transferred from recovery to ICU in a satisfactory condition.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, ,Vital Signs:
