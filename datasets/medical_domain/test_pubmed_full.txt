Trunk fat is lower in obese women with PWS than in those with essential obesity. Surrogate markers of CMD are, however, mostly similar in the two groups.
Current systems for clinical coding promote diversity rather than consistency of clinical coding. As the UK moves towards an integrated health IT system consistency of coding will become more important. A standardised, limited list of codes for primary care might help address this need.
Irradiation of the RBCs and a reduced fetal antioxidant capacity do not lead to in vivo lipid peroxidation. The shorter life span of donor cells in the fetus probably results from a decreased deformability of the RBCs after transfusion, most likely owing to an increased cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio.
An effective interactive workshop intervention employing blended instructional techniques may help improve the management of dental emergencies and patient outcomes.
De-escalation therapy did not lead to RP or increased mortality in critically ill surgical patients with VAP. De-escalation therapy was also shown to be safe in patients with septic shock. Because of its acknowledged benefits and lack of demonstrable risks, de-escalation therapy should be used whenever possible in critically ill patients with VAP.
Urinary tract colonization or infection may offer protection against sudden intrauterine unexplained death. We hypothesize that the subsequent maternal immune response offers transplacental protection against lethal fetal infections by common pathogens of urinary tract infections. Other health indicators have little impact on sudden intrauterine unexplained death.
Our findings suggest that translocation of LPS occurs after LTx and that LBP is mediating the LPS-induced inflammatory response after LTx. Blocking LBP using LBP-inhibitory peptide might represent a novel strategy to reduce the I/R-induced inflammatory response.
This study provides cross-sectional evidence for a relationship between depressive symptoms and BMI in preadolescent girls, but not in preadolescent boys. This relationship seems to be explained by an excess of overweight concerns. Assessing overweight concerns may be a useful method to identify those overweight girls who are at highest risk for associated depressive symptoms.
CT-generated radiographs are as good as plain radiographs for experienced surgeons for classifying acetabular fractures in obese patients. CT-generated imaging may be valuable in both teaching and clinical settings, and it may spare the patient additional radiation exposure and discomfort.
Cancer patients and healthy persons widely disregard instructions laid down in advance directives and consider them less binding than physicians and nursing staff do. Only a minority tends to adhere more to advance directives. To improve decision-making at the end of life when patients are no longer able to decide for themselves alternative concepts, such as advanced care planning, should be considered.
EMA-positive patients with initially normal histology should have a further duodenal biopsy. In our series three of the five newly diagnosed coeliac disease patients only had villous atrophy demonstrable in the jejunum. There may be a role for push enteroscopy in making the diagnosis of coeliac disease. However, further prospective studies are needed.
Prompting people to go to psychiatric out-patient clinics for the first time encourages them to attend. Pragmatic trials within a busy working environment are possible and informative.
Management of traumatic urethral disruption injuries by primary endoscopic realignment serves as definitive therapy in more than a third of treated patients. It prevents the need for formal urethroplasty in more than half of failed cases.
The Indurometer is easier to use as compared to the Tonometer. Modification of the Indurometer needs to take place in order to improve its variability before it can be considered as a replacement for the Tonometer in the assessment of lymphedema. The lack of understanding of the ISL classification system is a significant issue.
The results indicate that there is a close association between weak or strong p16 expressions in ASCUS-categorized smears with the presence of SILs in follow-up biopsies and positive HR-HPV viral loads. Conversely, there is also a clear association between the lack of p16 expression and the absence of significant lesions in follow-up biopsies, but this is not consistent with a negative HR-HPV viral load. It is concluded that p16 expression is an indicator of pathogenic activity of HR-HPV, which is an objective biomarker for clarification of ASCUS-categorized Pap smears in gynecological cytopathology. Furthermore, through comparative analysis, directly visualized p16 immunostaining on smears appears to be a more effective method than HR-HPV viral load for the detection of reactive changes and LSILs from ASCUS-categorized Pap smears.
Our study suggests that the cross-reactivity of the BDG test with a concomitant or recent bacteraemia is a very rare condition. Patients with risk factors for IFI should be evaluated cautiously when a positive BDG test is reported.
Although our data indicate that COH improves the pregnancy rate over IUI without COH, IUI without COH generates acceptable pregnancy rates in couples with cervical factor subfertility. Since IUI without COH bears no increased risk for multiple pregnancy, this treatment should be seriously considered in couples with cervical factor subfertility.
The answer to the question 'Are ethical principles respected when women are proposed ultrasound screening during the first trimester of pregnancy?' is clearly 'No'. Major effort is required to ensure that the decisions made by patients are based on a possibility of true choice.
The summit of hearing preservation has not been reached as improvements are still achieved even in most difficult conditions.
Neither MRI with conventional body-coild nor CT are sufficient to indicate local extension of disease in clinically localized prostate cancer.
On the basis of the detection of neuroendocrine markers on the primary neoplasm, together with pancreatic metastases positive on a 68Ga-DOTA-NOC positron emission tomography (PET), we hypothesize and discuss about a potential role of specific neuroendocrine markers as predictive indicators of response to sunitinib (and allegedly to other target therapies) in the treatment of this neoplasm.
The results do not support previous conclusions that genital circumcision is related to perinatal death, regardless of other circumstances, and suggest that other, suboptimal factors contribute to perinatal death among circumcised migrant women.
Although enrolees were drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds, those most likely to quit tended to reside in affluent areas or areas with a low proportion of Māori. There was no evidence that this smoking cessation programme increased or decreased inequalities within the Christchurch population. For smoking cessation programmes to have an impact on health inequalities more effort is required in targeting hard-to-reach groups and in encouraging them to quit.
Overall these respondents shared similar views and experiences, and both were influenced by similar factors. Multidisciplinary outcome measurement education and training is feasible and required. Multidimensional and brief PROMs that include physical and psychological domains need to be prioritized, and access to freely available, validated and translated tools is needed to ensure cross-national comparisons and coordination of international research.
CE appears to be a useful tool in the evaluation of patients with nonbleeding indications. The outcome of most patients with negative findings was excellent.
These data suggest that propofol and sevoflurane are valid anesthetic agents for the evaluation of IOP in adults when anesthesia is needed.
Fatigue is very common and often severe in HIV-infected out-patients, despite viral suppression and good immune function. In a subgroup of patients, prior d-drug exposure may contribute to fatigue, suggesting a metabolic basis. Dysautonomia may also drive fatigue associated with HIV infection, as in other chronic diseases, and CFS/ME, and should be further evaluated with the potential for a shared therapeutic approach.
Vasodilatation immediately prior to CC in severe HS occurs at the same time as an increase in LIR, suggesting loss of tone as the mechanism causing CC, and energy failure as its probable cause.
Obesity and smoking showed increased CIPP (maximal Intravesical Peak Pressures generated by Cough). While reduced BMI is related to lower CIPP, smoking cessation does not appear to diminish CIPP. These findings suggest that weight loss may reduce incontinence by CIPP modulation. However, the benefits of smoking cessation without additional lifestyle modification, may have no benefit to improve urinary incontinence.
The reported risk of adenocarcinoma in subjects with BE is low and not significantly decreased by a surgical antireflux procedure. Antireflux surgery in the setting of BE should not be recommended as an antineoplastic measure.
Meaningful comparisons in body image across cancer and non-cancer women can be made using two of the Multidimensional Body Self-Relations Questionnaire--Appearance Scales. The overweight preoccupation subscale could be used to assess body image but should not be used if group mean differences are desirable. Assessing satisfaction with body areas across these groups is not recommended and may introduce systematic bias.
Analyzing the results, the trephination may be performed at variable points of the frontal sinus, but the distance of 1 cm from midline appears to be safer and shows better aesthetic results.
ER reduced hemarthrosis, anterior capsule detachment and labral lesions, and never the contrary. The interest of immobilization in ER to prevent shoulder instability needs confirming by long-term clinical studies; we are therefore extending the present MRI study by a clinical study of ER immobilization in all patients showing significant labral lesion reduction.
Mortality rates and Injury Severity Scores were reduced for bilateral and unilateral femoral fractures compared with data reported 15 years ago from the same center. The improved outcome might be related in part to changes in resuscitation, triage, intensive care, and orthopaedic management of the patients. However, considering that the Injury Severity Score also significantly decreased, the improvement might have occurred because of changes in injury patterns, perhaps secondary to improved safety features in motor vehicles.
Thyroid lobectomy is an effective surgical strategy to manage papillary microcarcinomas with low complications. Routine completion thyroidectomy is not mandatory. Appropriate selection excluding high-risk patients is of paramount importance in order to achieve the best results.
Redo perineal rectosigmoidectomy is as safe and feasible as primary perineal rectosigmoidectomy in elderly and fragile patients with recurrent full-thickness rectal prolapse. However, the re-recurrence rate for full-thickness rectal prolapse is substantially higher for redo perineal rectosigmoidectomy than primary perineal rectosigmoidectomy.
There is no reason to recommend a change of that part of our lifestyle. We find weak associations to previous gastrointestinal infections, which gives a hint that development of type 1 diabetes may be related to problems in the gut and maybe one should look closer into the microbes living in the gut.
Overall, good agreement was observed in MA angle data between the two imaging modalities, but reproducibility may be problematic. In the malaligned limb, weight-bearing FLX still remains a vital imaging modality. CTS should be used with caution in view of the under-detection of malalignment.
Primary care physicians are in contact with adolescents who have excessive weight and eating concerns. Identification of these concerns should be encouraged for appropriate management.
This study shows that nurse-supervised EST of higher risk patients in the hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation setting has been a safe practice from a mortality and morbidity rate perspective. This finding may be accounted for by the high training standard and reaccreditation of the nurses on the advanced practice of performing EST.
We found no association between early life stunting and overweight/obesity, thinness and HBP in adolescence.
The results indicate that arthrocentesis, in association with MM and IA, could be effective in improving function and reducing pain in patients with closed lock. Better results were obtained in terms of MMO, VAS, and questionnaire scores in acute closed lock cases than in chronic ones. Recapturing the anteriorly displaced disc is possible only in patients with acute closed lock.
In this selected population of COPD patients, a high proportion of patients remained in the same spirometric GOLD grade or improved in a long-term follow-up. These findings suggest that once diagnosed, COPD is usually a non-progressive disease.
Psychometric properties of the ABC-NL were satisfactory. Further research is needed for use in high-functioning older persons.
Short-term intervention with increased prosthetic mass had no significant adverse affect on gait speed, and more than half of the subjects preferred an added mass condition.
These results suggest the existence of hepatorenal reflex in man which is important in the regulation of RBF, although other mechanisms may also be contributory.
Based on this observation, coupled with the previous report and the complex pathophysiology of this phenomenon, we suggest that osmotic diuresis be considered a possible therapeutic option for MDMA-associated acute symptomatic hyponatremia.
In a neonatal animal model there is no evidence of a programming of adult body weight and composition by wide-spectrum antibiotic treatment in early life.
When provided with information on adverse fetal outcome, healthcare professionals provide a more pessimistic evaluation of basic tracing features, overall classification, and clinical management recommendations.
Histopathologic request for tonsillectomy specimens should be based on certain risk factors with consideration of the cost to patients and to spare the histopathologist's man hour.
It is not clear that the BRAF(V600E) mutation is useful for prediction of poor prognosis of PTC.
Rupture rates of large AAAs reported in different studies are highly variable. There is emerging evidence that patients anatomically suitable for endovascular repair have lower rupture rates.
In select high-risk patients, on-pump, beating-heart coronary artery bypass grafting may be an acceptable trade-off between conventional cardioplegia and off-pump operations. It is still associated with the potentially detrimental effects of cardiopulmonary bypass but eliminates intraoperative global myocardial ischemia.
Nearly two-thirds of CRT-D patients had AHR episodes within 2.5 years after implantation. Almost 90% of AHRs were indeed AA. Misdetections were caused by far-field sensing or noise. A two-step diagnostic algorithm (>9% of time spent in AHRs and episode duration>36 s) allowed for proper detection of AA with a high hit-rate and specificity.
Maternal anxiety may be an independent risk factor for nonadherence to exclusive breastfeeding for the initial six months.
This retrospective review confirms the indolent but progressively fatal nature of LGOs. Contrast enhancement was the most evident single prognostic factor. New treatment strategies are clearly needed in the management of this disease.
Bacterial translocation is a unique physiologic event, which is increased during pregnancy and lactation in rodents. Human breast milk cells contain a limited number of viable bacteria but a range of bacterial DNA signatures, as also found in maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Those peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed greater biodiversity than did peripheral blood mononuclear cells from control women. Taken together, our results suggest that intestinally derived bacterial components are transported to the lactating breast within mononuclear cells. We speculate that this programs the neonatal immune system to recognize specific bacterial molecular patterns and to respond appropriately to pathogens and commensal organisms.
MLL is a rare diagnosis but is encountered in large-volume breast practices. The findings are nonspecific with a range of imaging appearances. No imaging test is reliable for differentiating MLL from other suspicious lesions or lesions with associated atypia. Surgery is clearly warranted for MLL associated with atypia at core needle biopsy because it may be upgraded to malignancy upon excision. However, if the presence of atypia at excision of benign MLL will change clinical management, then benign MLL at core needle biopsy warrants surgical excision in some cases. In patients whose treatment will not change if atypia is found at excision, close surveillance with short-interval follow-up is a reasonable alternative.
Discrepancies between registry entries and published articles for primary and non-primary outcomes were common among trials published in leading medical journals. Novel approaches are required to address this problem.
The reduction of OBV does not seem to represent an index of neuronal damage in the earliest stages of AD.
Fecal levels of Cg and Sg may be related to the underlying pathophysiology of IBS and of potential importance for symptoms of the patients. Granins also show promise to serve as future biomarkers of IBS. Further studies are needed to explore the potential role of granins in IBS patients.
Independent of established CVD risk factors, ED is significantly associated with increased CVD incidence. Nonetheless, ED does not improve the prediction of who will and will not develop CVD beyond that offered by traditional risk factors.
These findings suggest that public health recommendations for weight control may need to place greater emphasis on persistence of weight control behaviours.
RSBY could be the platform for universal health insurance when (i) the budget allocation will match the required funds for maintenance and expansion of the scheme; (ii) the scheme would ensure that beneficiaries' rights are legally anchored; and (iii) RSBY would attract large numbers of premium-paying (non-BPL) households.
Bovine adrenomedullary cells in primary culture do not include a population of tonically active cholinergic cells.
Future training may need to focus on responding well to neglect and people diagnosed with psychosis, on making treatment referrals, and on initiating discussions about reporting to authorities.
Our results demonstrating poorer reproductive performance in very young patients were surprising and need further investigation.
The results suggest that peripheral dopamine might be involved in modulating peripheral pain. This finding, in addition to reports in other studies, suggests that dopaminergic pathways could be implicated in the pathophysiology of M-TMD but also in other chronic pain conditions. More research is warranted to elucidate the role of peripheral dopamine in the pathophysiology of chronic pain.
For women, comprehensive WHP availability contributed to a sense of organizational support, potentially impacting the esteem component of reward. Men with higher WHP participation also benefitted but gains were modest over time and may have been hindered by other work environment factors.
As abnormal ultrasonographic findings return to normal over time in asymptomatic patients, the diagnosis of RPOC should not be based on ultrasonographic findings.
Extrahepatic dissection and clamping of the hepatic veins does not predispose to clinically important thrombosis.
While most of patients receiving OHT for BC are fasting during Ramadan, this does not negatively impact compliance with treatment.
In stable critically ill patients, dopamine acted primarily as a diuretic and did not improve creatinine clearance. Dobutamine improved creatinine clearance without a significant change in urine output.
For the evaluation of intracranial arteries using DSA as the gold standard, perfusion CTA yields image quality and vascular visualization similar to conventional CTA at an acceptable radiation dose.
Our results suggest that care level and cognitive impairment are generally correlated in the primary assessment, but some adjustment measure for cognitive impairment is needed in mildly or moderately physically disabled patients.
Age 70 years and older compared with age 69 years and younger was associated with higher occurrence of SWI after bilateral ITA grafting, but this interaction was not statistically significant. Larger studies are needed to test this interaction.
Although there is overrepresentation of African Americans among patients with major risk factors for NASH, individuals of primarily African American descent are infrequently represented among our patients with NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis. This could result from underrecognition, underreferral, or a true lower prevalence of these disorders among African Americans.
While the use of tablets such as the iPad by residents is generally well received, high initial expectations highlight the danger of implementing new technologies. Education on the realistic expectations of iPad benefits may be warranted.
LLSEC should be carried out by laparoscopy in centres where they have considerable experience. The patients may have a shorter hospital stay and spend less time in surgery than when OS is performed, with the same morbidity and mortality rates. Segmentectomy resections II or III carried out by laparoscopy involve a shorter hospital stay but longer surgery time and therefore the advantages are not as evident as they are for LLSEC.
The bipolar arthroplasty was found to give reproducible results also when residents take the responsibility of hip fracture treatment.
Little support was found for the hypothesis that nursing care by OCNs(r) results in superior patient outcomes in comparison to care by noncertified nurses.
The association between DUP and poor outcome may be spurious, confounded by the fact that poor premorbid functioning is independently associated with both DUP and poor outcome, with no direct causal link between these two latter variables. DUP may also be on the causal pathway between poor premorbid functioning and poor outcome, poor adjustment delaying access to care, and subsequently increasing the risk of presenting with a non-remitting course of illness. The links between premorbid functioning, DUP and outcome have to be further explored to clarify the directions of the associations between these variables.
In our study population, sudden death was precipitated by acute coronary thrombosis in only 27% of patients with obstructive coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Most of the young victims of sudden death with obstructive coronary atherosclerosis showed single-vessel disease that affected the left anterior descending coronary artery and was due to fibrous plaques with neointimal smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and a preserved tunica media in the absence of acute thrombosis.
Water is an efficient "negative" contrast agent for the differentiation of the small bowel from the colon on the planning abdomino-pelvic CT. Nevertheless, the delineation was really made easier only when the fractionated protocol of water absorption within half an hour before CT was used.
Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is rare in former elite marathon runners. The risk of osteoarthritis of the hip joint seems to be higher than in control subjects who do not engage in much sport.
Our data suggest some clinical criteria that may facilitate selection of candidates to curative surgery, which offers the best survival chances, especially when associated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
The MMN is a good predictor of awakening in comatose patients after cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock and can be measured days before awakening encouraging ongoing life support.
We feel that it is not necessary to perform yearly check cystoscopies in patients with augmented bladders at least in the first 15 years, as cancer has not yet been detected with surveillance cystoscopy in this patient group. However, if the patient develops haematuria or other worrisome symptoms including suprapubic pain and recurrent unexplained UTIs a full evaluation, including cystoscopy and computerized tomography should be undertaken.
Reducing the use of bedrails did not alter patient fall rates significantly, but it was associated with a reduction in serious injuries. Unless it can be shown that bedrails are beneficial, their continued use in older patients must be seriously questioned.
This study reveals no evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal mercury exposure has adverse long-term effects on offspring BP or heart rates during childhood or adolescence.
IA is recommended during the surgical clipping of complex or large aneurysms and some middle cerebral artery aneurysms. High cost-benefit ratio, false-negative rate, and moderate risk, however, preclude routine use. With future technological advances, IA may warrant broader use by replacing postoperative studies in the neurosurgical management of intracranial aneurysms.
The results suggest that there may be an effect of high maternal BMI on the sons' semen quality, but the study had only enough power to justify a critical evaluation of the hypothesis in a larger study.
The finding of T1b tumor was connected with a significantly higher risk of progression and understaging. The fascin-1 expression did not correlate with the depth of tumor invasion or with the tumor recurrence or progression.
Our results demonstrate that an EGD before TEE can elucidate findings that may preclude the passage of a blind probe in patients with upper GI symptoms or known esophageal disease. Therefore, we propose that an EGD is clinically beneficial before TEE and can change patient management.
The Jarman index seems to be the least appropriate of these indices for health authority use. Unemployment rate merits further consideration as a simple, up to date marker for deprivation and consequent need for health service provision.
The black geode sign may be fairly specific to extracranial schwannomas on gadolinium-enhanced MR images.
The clinical outcome, especially with regard to urethral abnormalities with this reusable silicone catheter is as good as with a disposable one. However, to reuse urinary catheters, one should consider the increasing risk of infection. For SCI patients in developing countries, CIC with a reusable silicone catheter may be a suitable and safe choice if one cleans and applies it properly to reduce infection. In order to answer the question how long a person in a developing country should use the same silicone catheter, further research should be conducted.
The results of this study suggested that an increased posterior tibial slope was associated with the risk of noncontact ACL injury in Chinese population. Meanwhile, the longitudinal axis method is recommended for measuring posterior tibial slope in lateral radiograph in future studies. Posterior tibial slope measured by longitudinal axis method may be used as predictor of ACL injury.
The additional use of intragastric balloon conferred no benefit over structured weight management alone in achieving pre-operative weight loss in a super-obese patient population. In the context of limited resources within NHS Lothian, the continued use of intragastric balloon in this way cannot be justified.
In the absence of explicit criteria, we found modest but statistically significant agreement among radiologists about the appropriateness of individual requests for imaging procedures. The disagreement among radiologists highlights the importance of developing well-reasoned, explicit criteria by which to judge the appropriateness of diagnostic radiology procedures. Further study is needed to elucidate the relationship between appropriateness and actual patient outcomes.
TB prevalence was similar among men and women. Case detection among men and women was significantly lower than the reported national case detection of 80%, and there was a significant underdetection of female cases. These findings warrant actions, and emphasize the need to perform similar studies in different contexts.
Gall stones are frequently associated with increased SO tone which may obstruct bile flow thus acting to facilitate gall bladder stasis, and may play a role as a cofactor in biliary/pancreatic pain.
Inking is a common anti-predator defense in cephalopods, thought to act like a smokescreen, decoy or distraction. Female dumpling squid are probably using this form of defense in response to the increase in predation risk prior to mating. Conversely, males were undeterred by the increase in predation risk. A lack of change in these variables may occur if the benefit of completing mating outweighs the risk of predation. Prioritizing current reproduction, even under predation risk, can occur when the chance of future reproduction is low, there is substantial energetic investment into mating, or the potential fitness payoffs of mating are high.
Pre-consultation distress screening in clinic is widely used. Reassuringly, it only modestly overestimates distress measured later at home and consequently would result in a small proportion of unnecessary further assessments. We conclude it is a reasonable and convenient strategy.
In daily practice, the intended curative resection for lung cancer cannot be considered complete in the majority of patients, because of an incomplete lymph node dissection according to the current guidelines of the ESTS.
Children and adolescents who live in environments in which people they see on a daily basis, such as parents and schoolmates, are overweight/obese may develop inaccurate perceptions of what constitutes appropriate weight status. Targeting misperception may facilitate the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors and improve the effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions.
Pancreatic resections with AR for adenocarcinoma allowed to obtain a 3-survival rate similar to that of a matched group of patients not requiring AR.
Surgical cricothyrotomy in the field can be performed reliably by specially trained nurses. Because only the most critically ill or injured patients with unmanageable airways are subjected to this procedure, a significant complication rate can be anticipated.
Our results indicate an important role for clonal growth in the space consolidation of native Phragmites and could explain why the introduced lineage, with stronger competitive traits, has not replaced the native where they co-occur. These results with regard to clone size, size distributions, singleton occurrence, and clonal architecture provide some evidence for stand development that follows a genotypic initial floristics model.
In both normal volunteers and patients suffering from GO, a rise in IOP was observed in conventional upgaze tonometry. However, this increase in IOP was partially due to applanation on the peripheral cornea. Measurements in upgaze by head inclination on the central cornea led to a significant lowering of the gaze-dependent IOP change. The discriminating power of the IOP difference between upgaze and primary position to diagnose GO was found to be limited. The broad overlap of IOP between normal individuals and GO patients as detected by conventionally performed upgaze tonometry leads us to conclude that this sign may not be of relevant differential diagnostic value in patients with a clinically undetermined diagnosis.
The type of procedure better accounts for differences in LOS by describing six statistically distinct procedure groups rather than the traditional two CMGs. It is reasonable therefore to consider changing the current CMG codes for gynaecology to a classification based on the type of procedure.
This study of non-invasive testing for H. pylori in young dyspeptic patients has demonstrated an improvement in symptom severity and a substantial reduction in OGD workload over a 2-year period.
Our single center analysis with the same surgical team before and after the preoperative chemotherapy era show that it remains unpredictable whether surgery in a child with Wilms tumor is safer and easier after preoperative chemotherapy.
If a cement technique is chosen to implant a glenoid component, the vacuum assist weep-hole technique is the most effective cementing technique to achieve durable fixation.
Enterococcal prosthetic joint infection is uncommon at our institution. Patients receiving combination therapy and those receiving monotherapy did not differ with respect to outcome. There were more cases of ototoxicity in the combination therapy group than there were in the monotherapy group.
Since measured vibrations in the support and throttle handles are significantly differed, measurements should be taken at both locations. Factors influencing vibration variability include the presence/absence of an auto balance unit, wheel and operator, but other factors remain to be elucidated.
LVEpiP and BiVP increase QT, JT, and TDR by altering the transmural sequence of activation of the intrinsically heterogeneous ventricular myocardium. Our data suggest that the resultant exaggeration of arrhythmic substrates can lead to the development of TdP in a subset of patients.
We found an association between higher admission body temperature and improved outcome in tPA-treated stroke patients with normal admission CTA of the cerebral arteries. This may suggest a beneficial effect of higher body temperature on clot lysis in the absence of visible clots on CTA.
Assessment of asthma severity after 1 h of treatment is better than initial severity assessment for determining the need for hospital admission for patients initially assessed as having 'moderate' asthma and for predicting the need for ICU in patients initially assessed as 'severe'.
Our data suggest that there is a relationship between the rate of high-grade tumours and prostate volume even in biopsy and RP specimens and it is not an artefact related to the biopsy.
The presence of MetSyn was not associated with HRQoL according to the Mental Component Summary Score. In HD patients, HRQoL and depressive behaviors were not influenced by MetSyn, but by various other factors.
Colectomy in patients with IBD complicated with cirrhotic primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with a high early postoperative morbidity rate. Due consideration needs to be given to strategies to reduce pelvic sepsis, especially after ileoanal pouch, because this is associated with mortality.
PEF responses to metal-working fluid aerosols do not distinguish occupational asthma from alveolitis except in timing. They can be used to identify the workplace as the cause of asthma and also alveolitis.
Emergency department physicians frequently miss specific radiographic abnormalities and there is considerable discrepancy between their interpretations and those of trained radiologists. These findings highlight the importance of routine evaluation of chest radiographs by a well trained radiologist and emphasise the need for improving interpretive skills among emergency department physicians.
Leadership skills training in the education of psychiatrists should contain both practical experience with leadership and management roles and formal teaching sessions on leadership and management skills development. Suggestions for improvement of the leadership and management skills education in the training of psychiatrists have been formulated.
Muscle relaxants during nasal intubation performed after bolus administration of propofol 0.9 mg/kg in addition to 10 minutes of remifentanil 0.5 μg/kg per minute plus propofol 5 mg/kg per hour are unnecessary.
The results of our study have shown that in patients with solitary distal ureter stones, the degree of hydronephrosis caused by the stone does not affect the overall treatment success with shock wave lithotripsy. However, stones in obstructed systems tended to require repeat treatment and prolonged time for stone clearance.
Surgeons are slightly more likely to recommend surgery for a patient than they are to choose surgery for themselves and they choose for themselves with a little more confidence. Different perspectives, preferences, circumstantial information, and cognitive biases might explain the observed differences. This emphasizes the importance of (1) understanding patients' preferences and their considerations for treatment; (2) being aware that surgeons and patients might weigh various factors differently; (3) giving patients more autonomy by letting them balance risks and benefits themselves (ie, shared decision-making); and (4) assessing how dispassionate evidence-based decision aids help inform the patient and influences their decisional conflict.
LEMG is an important and useful technique, but caution must be taken to avoid misinterpretation and the wrong muscle approach.
We found a very low complication rate following CAS with embolic protection performed by an experienced physician who has a relatively low CAS volume but a high volume of other peripheral interventions.
The combination of quantitative parameters of presynaptic DAT and postsynaptic D(2) receptor binding demonstrates superior diagnostic power in the differentiation of patients with IPS and non-IPS than the established approach based on D(2) binding alone. Striatal D(2) receptor binding and the combination of DAT and IBZM binding asymmetries are the factors contributing most in separating these diagnostic groups.
This study has shown that prior endoscopic experience enables trainees to interpret capsule endoscopy more accurately than medical students. However, there is a demand for focussed training which would enable trainees to reliably interpret pathology on capsule endoscopy.
In the present evaluation midline incision was the most frequently applied access in elective open abdominal surgery. None of the treatments for abdominal wall closure (except skin closure in the midline group) is performed on a consensus level.
These findings in parents and siblings suggest that some susceptibility genotypes raise the risk for both generalized and localization-related epilepsies but are more common in persons affected with generalized epilepsy. The different findings in offspring may reflect a different influence on susceptibility in that subgroup.
These findings suggest an important correlation between the competence to consent to treatment and insight, a clinical variable currently assessed by clinicians. We hypothesized that this link could be mediated by cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Emphasis should be placed on developing prospective studies comparing the courses of insight, cognitive disorders and capacity to consent in schizophrenia.
13C-urea breath test values with citric acid are higher than those obtained without citric acid, although this difference does not imply a diagnostic superiority in untreated patients when considering 13C-urea breath test without citric acid at 30'. Therefore, for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in untreated patients, citric acid solution in 13C-urea breath test protocol can be omitted.
Because the HCT combinations with other tests improved the diagnostic value of HCT, they should be preferred in some individuals suspected of having urolithiasis. However, the most feasible single test meeting the all usage purposes was HCT in terms of the AROC value, and the combination was [HCT or USG] in which either HCT or USG was positive.
MCI subtype is a significant independent predictor of conversion to dementia, with aMCI patients having higher risk than naMCI for conversion throughout the 5-year follow-up period. WML severity does not influence conversion to dementia for aMCI but might accelerate progression in naMCI.
The percentage of LH increased over the last decade and by 2010 had surpassed AH. The 43.4% LH rate in 2010 is much higher than previously reported in national surveys. This likely is due to an increase in the number of laparoscopic procedures being performed over the last few years as well as the ability of our study to capture LH prior to development of appropriate ICD-9 procedure codes. Our unique ability to determine hysterectomy route, which predates appropriate coding, may provide a more accurate characterization of hysterectomy trends.
There is some evidence to suggest the introduction of the integrated service model has resulted in a decline in ED visits among PCS patients. Further research is needed to evaluate whether the observed reduction persists.
Plasma PAF levels correlating with the severity of HIE is interpreted to mean that high PAF levels may be an indicator of clinical severity and probably the poorer prognosis of patients with HIE.
In this population of renal transplant patients, the decrease in neutrophil count, used as a surrogate marker of haematological toxicity, was associated with ganciclovir triphosphate accumulation in blood cells. Further studies are needed to test this biomarker as a predictive factor for toxicity.
In the present study a significant proportion of penile cancer histology reports were revised after review by the Sn-MDT. Many of these changes altered patient management. The present study shows that accurate pathological diagnosis plays a crucial role in determining the correct treatment and maximizing the potential for good clinical outcomes in penile cancer. In the case of histopathology, centralization has increased exposure to penile cancer and thereby increased diagnostic accuracy, and should therefore be considered the 'gold standard'.
We found neither a beneficial nor a harmful effect of smoking on long-term incidence. Selective mortality among smokers and patients with PDR at baseline might provide at least part of the explanation for this.
Among patients with isolated hip fractures admitted to HLTCs, mortality and discharge disposition do not differ from similar patients admitted to LLTCs. These findings have important implications for trauma systems and triage protocols.
The prevalence of cryptogenic HCC was significantly increased in Korea during the last decade. Although statistically insignificant, there was a trend toward the higher proportion of risk factors with NAFLD in patients with cryptogenic HCC. This suggests that increased proportion of risk factors associated for NAFLD may have contributed to the development of cryptogenic HCC.
Decision trees could help nurses to make complex clinical decisions. Further studies undertaken in a clinical setting are needed.
Personality facets hostility and vulnerability to stress did not modify the relation between road traffic noise exposure and somatic symptom reporting, or confound relations between noise annoyance and symptoms.
Surgery may play a role in responding patients. In patients with progressive disease, the role of surgery is more difficult to distinguish in this retrospective analysis since PFS is short. Which patients benefit and whether this improves long-term outcome should be established in a multicentric randomized trial.
The study findings strongly indicate that further attention needs to be directed towards improving the workers' relationship with supervisors and social insurance officers. Findings apply in particular to women.
The observed changes in biventricular cardiac mass and function as well as changes in hemodynamic flow parameters in the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta are likely attributed to the physical fitness level of patients after lung transplantation, which in turn is strongly related to lung function.
GPs are willing to act as gatekeepers for social insurance benefits for their patients, also when eligibility criteria become restricted.
Thanks to its capacity for full ventricular support, short-term univentricular or biventricular LevotronixCentriMag VAD currently represents an ideal solution for bridge-to-decision.
TIPS is unquestionably an advancement in the management of patients with portal hypertension complications. Non-LT candidates, compared with LT candidates, tended to be older and of a Child-Pugh C class, and they had survival rates often less than 90 days post-TIPS. Given these high mortality rates, we need to address whether TIPS is indicated in these non-LT candidates.
There was no significant difference in the shunt infection rate between patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt who did and did not undergo preoperative bowel preparation. Our results add to the current literature suggesting that bowel preparation is unnecessary even in patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Maternal age of menopause predicts antral follicle count and its decline, indicating a genetic component to this trait.
The results indicate that retinal nerve fiber layer photographs are helpful in diagnosing glaucoma because early glaucomatous abnormalities cannot be excluded without nerve fiber layer photography. Currently available routine perimetric examination programs do not always detect very early functional damage.
The potential workload associated with the European hypertension guidelines could destabilise the healthcare system in Norway, one of the world's most long- and healthy-living nations, by international comparison. Large-scale, preventive medical enterprises can hardly be regarded as scientifically sound and ethically justifiable, unless issues of practical feasibility, sustainability and social determinants of health are considered.
Relatively small PSA-based trials in patients with hormone-unresponsive prostate cancer are possible if a similar patient population is utilized. As long as surrogacy is not established, such studies cannot be considered conclusive with respect to effectiveness of treatment, but are likely to be useful as a screening tool for new drugs. Experimental confirmation in human prostate cancer model systems of synergism between PSA decrease and tumor control by a given test treatment is likely to enhance the level of certainty of PSA-based drug evaluation.
As demonstrated, around 40% of patients if switched from FL-rFVIII to BDD-rFVIII would have lower concentrations of FVIII in the blood. It is essential that clinicians are aware of this possibility and that there is sufficient and appropriate follow-up of patients with hemophilia A who are switching the type of factor concentrate used in their treatment.
Pre-operative pulse oximetry should be used as a guide to help triage patients who require specialist paediatric services, such as a paediatric intensive care unit. The use of pulse oximetry, particularly in the post-operative setting, is unlikely to change patient management and can incur unnecessary financial costs to UK National Health Service Hospital Trusts.
Even under optimal conditions, it was not possible to achieve circumferential spread of LA in all intended cases. The success of median nerve block seems to be independent of the pattern of LA spread.
The study of cell cycle kinetics by flowcytometry might help in picking up, among all women with endometrial hyperplasia, the group of patients who need further close and strict follow up by endometrial pathologic study. This is going to minimize the cost and invasiveness of surveillance of patients with various grades of endometrial hyperplasia.
Image-guided needle biopsy, when performed by a specialist radiologist and evaluated by an experienced bone pathologist, is a useful tool in determining the histological grade of long-bone chondrosarcomas allowing identification of true low-grade tumors. The histological grade should be correlated with imaging and the clinical presentation, but under these circumstances, experienced tumor surgeons may use this information in planning surgical treatment. The same appears not to be true for pelvic lesions, in which histological grade established by needle biopsy should be interpreted with caution.
Public health efforts to reduce adolescent smoking must confront smoking in films as a tobacco marketing strategy.
No synergistic effect of local oestrogens and antimuscarinics in the treatment of OAB was found. Antimuscarinic treatment has lower cure rates in women with symptomatic DO complaining of incontinence at orgasm or in patients with DO following provocative manoeuvres. The association of local oestrogens does not influence the role of the two mentioned risk factors.
Using the present method, DNA concentration quantification appears to be simple, but with certain deficiencies due to inter-sample variability and low specificity. This is because total DNA concentration is measured without distinguishing as to whether it is tumour-related. We suggest that there is a correlation between DNA concentration and prognosis which enables an analysis of the natural history of the disease.
It was concluded from the results that the date of surgery is relevant for the appearance of chondral defects. Patient age is a further relevant factor for clinical outcome. Recovery after hip arthroscopy takes place mainly in the first 6 weeks after surgery.
Compared to traditional family physicians, hospitalists appear to improve measures of quality and resource utilization. Specifically, hospitalists demonstrate lower in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission rates while improving (or at least showing similar) length of stay. Compared to traditional subspecialists, hospitalists demonstrate similar performance despite looking after sicker and more complex medical patients.
Distress and cutoff score in prostate cancer patients were lower than in patients with other cancer types. Additionally, younger women and patients receiving treatment other than surgery only or 'wait and see' are at risk for higher distress. These results can help identify patients possibly in need of referral to professional psychosocial and/or allied health care.
A iatrogenic bile duct injury in an elderly person may prove a fatal complication. A repair surgery, i.e. the biliary-enteric anastomosis, is a major and burdensome procedure, particularly in the case of patients aged over 70 years. Special caution during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is advised in this population, and the slightest doubts should lead to conversion.
C3 laminectomy with laminoplasty can prevent interlaminar bony fusion at C2-C4 and, ultimately, result in better preservation of cervical ROM than C3 laminoplasty. Furthermore, it yields similar clinical outcomes when compared with C3 laminoplasty.
In this small series of patients, the presence of a positive PET 1 month after RT accurately indicated the presence of residual disease in all cases; however, a negative PET indicated absence of disease in only 14%. Further investigation is warranted before FDG-PET should be used to determine whether post-RT neck dissection should be omitted.
The implementation of a prognostic definition and wider adoption of integrated care could bring significant advantages. However, these measures require improved training in pain management and structural revision of specialist facilities, for which political support is essential.
Orthopaedic surgeons are likely over treating patients with Mason-Johnson type-I radial head fractures by recommending frequent radiographic follow-up without modifying treatment, leading to unnecessary patient visits, radiation exposure, and increased costs.
Although incidence of OPSCC did increase since 1989, especially in females, similar increases were seen for OCSCC (excl. oral tongue) and OTSCC. Our study does not appear to support that HPV is the main contributor to a rising incidence of OPSCC as the effects of changes in smoking and alcohol use cannot be discounted.
Both hypocalciuric and normocalciuric women responded to an oral calcium challenge by an increase in the calcium excretion. The cause of the hypocalciuria in women at increased risk for preeclampsia is therefore not simply poor absorption of calcium.
Chronic ST segment elevation after anteroseptal Q wave myocardial infarction does not exclude myocardial viability in the 'infarct zone'. Evaluation of residual tissue viability is indicated to assess the benefit of revascularization in patients with Q wave infarction and chronic ST segment elevation.
Abnormal cells were potentially lost on the broom, but were usually represented in the first vial. The likelihood of abnormal cells being discarded was operator dependent in this small study, but this did not affect the quality of the initial preparation. The likelihood of abnormal cells being seen on TP slides was dependent on their cellularity, which provided our laboratory with a criterion for the assessment of sample adequacy.
The data of the current study imply that the transmission of borderline symptoms from mother to child is mediated by maladaptive mother-child interactions. For this reason early and professional support may be useful to prevent these children from developing severe psychopathology.
Subtotal parathyroidectomy provides the best conditions for successful reoperation in case of recurrent hyperparathyroidism and should become the surgical treatment of choice for secondary hyperparathyroidism.
SWA is effective in cleaning occluded pancreatic endoprostheses in vitro. Prolongation of stent placement seems possible if regular SWA is performed. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy therefore might become a new indication for patients under treatment with pancreatic endoprostheses.
In a normal population of young adolescents, a low level of RSA does not identify adolescents at risk for depressive symptoms when confronted with SLEs. In post hoc analyses, among those reporting high exposure to stressful life events, higher RSA tended to predict less self-reported anxiety and more self-reported somatic symptoms as compared to those with lower RSA.
Patients with an advanced distal adenoma are twice as likely to have an advanced proximal adenoma as patients with a nonadvanced distal adenoma. However, eschewing a colonoscopy in patients with a nonadvanced distal adenoma would result in not detecting a sizeable percentage of the prevalent advanced proximal adenomas. These data support performance of a colonoscopy in patients with a nonadvanced distal adenoma. Confirmation of these results in asymptomatic subjects undergoing screening sigmoidoscopy is advisable.
Our results suggest that, although the determination of s-ECP levels are in accordance with clinical evaluation of disease activity, it is not useful in determining discontinuation of ICS therapy.
Our results highlight that meeting n-3 PUFA nutritional recommendation remains challenging for collective catering. A detailed analysis of provided menus represents a powerful tool to increase awareness and foster improvement in practice.
These preliminary findings are consistent with the interpretation that buprenorphine does not block auricular acupuncture, supporting the provisional recommendation that cocaine-abusing patients maintained on buprenorphine should not be excluded from receiving auricular acupuncture or from participating in clinical studies of this treatment modality. Further, controlled research on this issue, with clinical outcomes, is needed.
Our data show comparable or even better response and post-LT recurrence rates of CTB compared to TACE for treating HCC in patients prior to LT. CTB should be further evaluated as an alternative bridging modality, especially for patients not suited for TACE.
The high scores in 'extraversion' reflect the social, warm, active and talkative nature of urology residents. As well, urology residents tend to be willing to entertain new ideas and are purposeful and determined based on their high scores on 'openness' and 'conscientiousness' respectively. Canadian urology residents possess a distinct personality in comparison to the general population. These provocative findings should be interpreted with caution. If confirmed on a wider basis, the data may be helpful in career counseling and resident selection. Future studies examining differences between the urological personality and other surgical subspecialties may further refine applications of the data.
Most of the psychological characteristics we tested predicted outcome, but none predicted response to physiotherapist-guided exercise and/or advice.
Full delivery of EGDT by ED staff would require significant consultant support, improved training of juniors and flexibility in the 4 h target. This study suggests that it may be practical for EGDT to be initiated in the ED and that early referral to critical care will remain essential if patients are to receive the full benefit of this intervention.
The maximal hyperemic response of coronary artery was not always induced by conventional intravenous administration of ATP, especially in patients with lower CFR than 2.0. High dose of intravenous ATP and/or intracoronary ATP should be administered in patients with lower CFR to attain maximum hyperemia in the impaired coronary circulation.
PODCI and CCQ are able to capture outcome in children with CP.
Reduced serum PON1 activity might contribute to the increased susceptibility for the development of AHD in women with PCOS.
Not performing isthmectomy in parallel with tracheostomy leads the surgeon to open the tracheal stoma more distally than expected. In such cases, there were more stomal complications.
patients in whom clinical remission was confirmed may display persisting symptoms, relevant areas of functional impairment and a decreased sense of wellbeing.
Programs interested in peer referral could productively pursue the strategy without incurring incentive costs.
These findings show a relationship between vertebral endplate cyst formation in the early postoperative period and nonunion after lumbar interbody fusion. Endplate cyst formation is a useful early predictor of subsequent nonunion.
GPs' feelings of burnout or dissatisfaction with the time available for their patients do not obstruct their diagnosis and awareness of patients' psychological problems. On the contrary, GPs with high levels of exhaustion or depersonalisation, and GPs who are dissatisfied with the available time, sometimes provide more opportunities to discuss mental health problems. This increases the chance that appropriate care will be found for patients with mental health problems. On the other hand, these GPs are themselves more likely to retire, or risk burnout, because of their dissatisfaction. Therefore these GPs may benefit from training or personal coaching to decrease the chance that the process of burnout will get out of hand.
Stressful situations can cause both bruxism and cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery diseases, hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy. The statistical analysis supported this hypothesis. However, we need to new studies with large number of samples to confirm this hypothesis. Clearly, future studies in this field will need to take into consideration the influence of the following variables: age, use of medication or drugs, smoking habits, and other sleep disorders.
GPs appear to be less likely to recognise and to refer patients presenting with ovarian cancer as they get older. If our findings extend to other cancers, lack of or delays in referral to secondary care may partly explain poor UK cancer mortality rates of older people.
Radial artery seems to be an excellent alternate arterial conduit for myocardial revascularization with early and midterm patency rates equivalent to that of pedicled internal mammary artery, and it should be used more often for myocardial revascularization as an adjunct to pedicled internal mammary artery graft.
Trials of MET for new use as an anti-inflammatory agent are suggested. Guanidylguanidine is a practical pharmacophore for synthesis of future anti-lysosomal agents.
Previous studies have generally identified only one of these variables to be the main reason for faster running velocities. However, this study showed that there is a large variation of performance patterns among the elite athletes and, overall, SF or SL reliance is a highly individual occurrence. It is proposed that athletes should take this reliance into account in their training, with SF-reliant athletes needing to keep their neural system ready for fast leg turnover and SL-reliant athletes requiring more concentration on maintaining strength levels.
This study provided insights in how complementary therapists view a potential SC role. Research is needed to determine whether the findings are common to other areas of CT practice. Further training in SC support is suggested for those working in oncology settings.
AE correlates significantly with various objective clinical scores and chemokine markers of AD, and is a useful indicator for predicting moderate to severe AD in children.
Use of common sunscreen formulations that absorb UVB almost completely, but transmit large quantities of UVA, may contribute to risk of melanoma in populations at latitudes>40 degrees.
A structured information intervention additional to standard care during ICU stay had no demonstrated additional benefit compared to an unspecific communication of similar duration. Reduction of anxiety in ICU patients will probably require more continuous approaches to information giving and communication.
Based on the 62% regression rate in this study, routine treatment may not be necessary for all women with CIN2 who are<25 years old.
Fecal elastase-1 is the most simple and objective method for predicting pancreatic leakage after PD.
This was one of the first trials adding the treatment of SAM to a CHW workload and suggests that adding SAM to a well-trained and supervised CHW's workload, including preventive and curative tasks, does not necessarily yield lower quality of care. However, increased workloads had consequences for CHWs' domestic life, and further increases in workload may not be possible without additional incentives.
Suboptimal levels of serum 25(OH)D were found in the majority of our study participants particularly in winter and they would benefit from supplementation. Our study showed no statistically significant correlation between seasonal serum 25(OH)D levels and CD activity. Given the limitations of the study, the role of 25(OH)D as a predictor of disease activity could not be clearly concluded.
Pouch stones are established long-term complication of urinary diversion. Open and endoscopic approaches are valid treatment strategies.
Patients with HCC undergoing maintenance dialysis do not have a worse long-term survival. A longer duration of dialysis and absence of ascites formation are associated with a better outcome in dialysis patients. The CTP classification is a more feasible prognostic marker to indicate the severity of cirrhosis, and the JIS system may be a better staging model for outcome prediction.
Voxel-based analysis of DTI studies of patients with MDD consistently identified decreased fractional anisotropy in the white matter fascicles connecting the prefrontal cortex within cortical (frontal, temporal and occipital lobes) and subcortical areas (amygdala and hippocampus). This isstrong evidence for the involvement of these neural circuits in the pathology of MDD.
AT1 antagonists at doses that effectively reduce blood pressure in chronic therapy do not generally suppress peripheral sympathetic function. A potential interaction consists in a reduction of vascular noradrenaline sensitivity, which can be considered as a class effect of AT1 antagonists at high dosage.
VMAT resulted superior to 3DCRT in terms of dosimetric findings and clinical results.
These findings, based on consecutive cases, suggest that bupropion may pose the same risks as other antidepressants in precipitating manic episodes in depressed bipolar patients. The authors conclude that caution should be exercised when using bupropion in the treatment of bipolar disorders.
As ED triage volume was found to be the only factor associated with imaging volume for all techniques, analysis of predictors of ED triage volumes at a particular healthcare facility would be useful to determine imaging needs. Although calendar and weather factors were found to be minor or non-significant independent predictors of ED imaging utilisation, these may be important in influencing the actual number of ED triages.
Pretransplant LCM results were not associated with overall graft survival or acute rejection episodes in this study.
Greater access to specialized procedures does not explain the reduced mortality from preventable physical illness that had been reported in patients on community treatment orders. There must be other explanations for this finding, such as mental health staff facilitating access to chronic disease management in primary care. This warrants further research.
Training in spirometry did not result in any measurable improvement in the use of spirometry, quality of management of asthma or patient outcomes in primary care.
Changes in foveal slope were seen with increasing age; however, in diabetes these segmental slope changes can be seen in late DR (STDR).
The integration of ME and PR has the potential to increase our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding suicide and to better inform prevention efforts. However, before this potential can be reached, there are still issues that must be considered.
This large population-based cohort study demonstrated that patients in Taiwan with previous chronic rhinosinusitis are at greater risk of developing the adenocarcinoma subtype of lung cancer.
In cases requiring multiple dental management issues, the sedation method was not found to be a useful alternative to GA.
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) prostate cancer biopsy expression in our study was an independent prognostic factor of extracapsular stage (pT3a). Further studies will assess the relevance of ET-1 expression study in clinically localised PCa for active surveillance, curative treatment or targeted adjuvant therapy management.
Tobacco products are being promoted in the new 'smartphone app' medium which has global reach, a huge consumer base of various age groups and underdeveloped regulation. The paper also provides two examples of app store responses to country-specific laws and regulations that could be used to control the harmful contents in the app stores for individual countries.
The authors believe that all types of reconstruction should be an option for women older than 60 years of age and that age as an isolated factor should not deter physicians from offering these women the option of breast reconstruction.
ASP may not only be useful for learners but also offers chances and benefits for patient care.
Considering demographic change and the vulnerability of older persons to severe outcomes of mental illness such as suicide, the observed increase of negative attitudes over the life span seems highly relevant. We discuss the role of conservatism and preferences for agreeable social contacts in older age.
The only role of ERT in our opinion is in patients who arrive within 30 minutes of pre hospital time, with a witnessed vital signed in the field. Multiple wounds, low SBP and higher caliber bullet injuries are also negative prognostic factors.
Multiparity caused morphometric changes in pubococcygeus muscle but not in bulbospongiosus muscle. As OR expression was high for both muscles, some properties related to fibre composition or muscle physiology could be affected. The finding that serum oestradiol was not elevated at the end of the fourth pregnancy could be related to changes in pelvic and perineal muscles associated with multiparity.
Overall, plastic 'pseudobran' was as effective at altering colonic function as wheat bran at a similar dosage but with fewer particles. The mechanism is not by increased faecal water. Reduction in enzyme activity with plastic flakes suggests that the plastic led to qualitative and, probably, beneficial changes in the bacterial flora or their metabolic processes. The concept of roughage deserves to be revived.
This study shows that Sri Lankan children have unacceptably high body fat at levels that have been designated by growth charts as "normal". Children who are positioned at a higher SD score, +1 to +2SD, (within normal range) in the weight for age and BMI for age charts are mainly due to the deposition of fat rather than the growth in both fat and fat free compartments of body. Therefore the implication of using current cutoff values would be leading to the accumulation of excess fat in the body of those with higher SD values, but still considered to be within "normal" limits. Therefore in the absence of local standards, it would be important to revise the cutoff values of the WHO growth charts to suite Sri Lankan children which would be between -3SD and +1SD.
Total thoracic oesophagectomy can be performed in oesophageal cancer patients with comparable morbidity to that of lesser resections. Incomplete proximal resection and anastomotic recurrence did not occur in this series of 108 total thoracic oesophagectomies and this is reflected in an increased medium term survival. The improved survival is most apparent for tumours of the oesophago-gastric junction.
ART is usually associated with menstrual abnormality at late postoperative period and transrectal ultrasonograph during this procedure may decrease postoperative morbidity.
Laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe procedure for complicated appendicitis in children, but the greatest short-term benefit is cosmetic. Long-term results have to be evaluated, particularly with regards to the long-term complication rate.
A low socioeconomic status of an urban district will result in more ambulance responses. However, the proportion of life-threatening emergencies is equal to districts with a high socioeconomic status. Thus, the greater need for physician-staffed ambulance responses matches clinical needs and legitimates current resource use in a 2-tier ambulance system. Indications for the abuse of physician-staffed ambulances were not found. Considering an aging population the number of emergency calls will rise in the future.
This study showed that early weight-bearing after reamed static interlocking nailing of Winquist type II, III, and IV femoral fractures is a safe and effective method, and the risk of implant failure does not preclude the procedure.
Contrary to some prior studies, these findings suggest that racial disparities in alcohol problems may be more a function of racial/ethnic minorities' greater exposure, rather than vulnerability, to chronic stressors such as social adversity. However, observed differences between the poor and non-poor imply that differential vulnerability contributes to socioeconomic disparities in alcohol problems. Efforts to reduce both differential exposure and vulnerability might help to mitigate these disparities.
Integrated PET/MR is a feasible whole-body imaging modality and may score better than PET/CT for the detection of brain metastases. To further prove diagnostic utility, this technique requires further clinical validation.
In this study, the success rate of cryotherapy was highest in patients with abundant leucorrhoea and lowest in patients with pelvic pain and recurrent cervicitis. Hence, we recommend that clinicians perform the procedure in such patients without much delay.
Obese people with asthma had poorer asthma control than nonobese asthmatics despite similar symptoms perception. Bronchial and systemic inflammatory characteristics and the specific pattern of pulmonary function changes suggest a different phenotype of asthma in these subjects.
Single-agent treatment with D or the multitarget antifolate pemetrexed or erlotinib remain the best choices and investigational studies, following first-line therapy, are required.
Most patients do not know exactly what a FCM resident is or does. They believe that the presence of the resident does not affect the consultation with the tutor. Trust and tolerance is similar. Satisfaction with the care received is high.
The study indicates increased A+E service use and unmet health-related need within a total mental health population. It identifies specific 'care populations' particularly vulnerable to accidents and self-harm and highlights the need for targeted services for mentally ill groups who may not access traditional health and social care services effectively.
For patients with a SUD, clinicians should emphasize that abstinence may help to improve their QoL.
Important differences in nutritional status associated with continued breastfeeding are observed throughout the developing world, and are not likely due to confounding by family sociodemographic characteristics, health care utilization or recent child illness. A unifying interpretation of the observed relationships is that child size is somehow related to the decision to wean, and that whereas in SSA, the biggest children are weaned first, in non-SSA countries, the smallest children are weaned last.
This study suggest that renotrophin could be a multifactorial system that can cross the placenta. The fall in renal fetal weight following maternal nephrectomy was consequent to a lesser tissue water content. Hypoplasia or hypotrophy did not play a role in this event. However, the fall in fetal kidney water was independent of the amount of maternal renal tissue that was removed.
Current guidelines for high level disinfection using glutaraldehyde are appropriate. Alcohol rinse is a valuable adjunctive step for drying and for its bactericidal effects.
The results suggest that PRP application during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair did not clearly demonstrate accelerated recovery clinically or anatomically except for an improvement in internal rotation. Nevertheless, as the study may have been underpowered to detect clinically important differences in the structural integrity, additional investigations, including the optimization of PRP preparation and a larger randomized study powered for healing rate, are necessary to further determine the effect of PRP.
Breast clustered microcysts are relatively common, seen in 5.8% of breast sonograms. In our series of 79 lesions with follow-up, none proved malignant: Follow-up on an annual basis appears reasonable for most such lesions. Validation of this approach across multiple centers is needed.
Macrocephaly significantly correlates with the incidence of optic pathway gliomas in children with neurofibromatosis type 1. We therefore hypothesise that in otherwise asymptomatic patients, macrocephaly is an additional indicator for performing MRI to detect optic pathway gliomas.
The odds of severe hypo- and hyperglycemia were significantly greater with gatifloxacin and levofloxacin, but not ciprofloxacin, than with azithromycin. Thus, the risk of a clinically relevant dysglycemic event appears to vary among the fluoroquinolones.
. Presenting statistical information using a pictograph can reduce the undue influence of anecdotal reasoning on treatment choices.
The early emergence and developmental coherence of exposure-related conduct problems is striking and is consistent with a behavioral teratological model. Phenotypically, exposure-related conduct problems appear to be characterized by socially resistant and impulsively aggressive behavior. Whether prenatal smoking plays an etiological role in or is a risk marker for the development of conduct problems, exposed offspring are at increased risk of an early-starter pathway to conduct problems.
There is no difference in weight loss or weight regain between the SLL and LLL RYGB. Longer-limb gastric bypass is not required in patients with BMI>50 kg/m(2) for them to obtain long-term, sustained weight loss.
Our data showing an association between WT and average low SS locations support the role of local hemodynamics in the development of atherosclerotic lesions in descending thoracic aorta. Furthermore, SS does not seem to be the major predictor for plaque regression by lipid-lowering interventions. Therefore, our data suggest that other mechanisms are involved in the lipid-reversal mechanism.
Obesity is associated with prolonged decision-to-incision and decision-to-delivery intervals, without associated neonatal morbidity, in a tertiary hospital setting. Further studies are required to assess the specific factors limiting expedient delivery in this population.
The three investigated algorithms showed reasonable calibration in the prediction of mortality for reoperative aortic valve replacement, but they evenly overestimated the observed mortality. The hypothesis that the EuroSCORE II is better suited for the selection of candidates to Valve-in-Valve implantation is worth of further multi-institutional investigations on the basis of our preliminary findings and due to the expanding role of transcatheter techniques.
Significant variations in emergency readmission rates occurred between medical specialties, suggesting that differences between hospital trusts are influenced by differences in specialties and thus case mix. The majority of emergency readmissions occurred in patients with an underlying chronic condition, and many had a history of multiple previous hospital admissions. The emergency readmission rate is therefore unlikely to be a valid outcome indicator reflecting quality of care until routine data are available for standardisation by case mix.
From our study, perioperative detection of hAFP mRNA in peripheral blood of patients has no clinical relevance and significant role in the prediction of HCC recurrence. Surgical resection itself may not accelerate cancer dissemination and does not increase postoperative recurrence significantly either.
This study demonstrated prevalent vitamin D deficiency in insulin resistant type 2 diabetic and normal subjects. Insulin resistance did not influence the status of vitamin D.
When pre-operative Hb levels and renal function are taken into account, moderate transfusions of RBC after CABG surgery do not seem to be associated with reduced long-term survival.
It was shown that one session of acupuncture treatment results in acute improvements in pressure pain sensitivity in the neck and calf of patients with chronic WAD. Acupuncture had no effect on conditioned pain modulation or temporal summation of pressure pain. Both acupuncture and relaxation appear to be well-tolerated treatments for people with chronic WAD. These findings suggest that acupuncture treatment activates endogenous analgesia in patients with chronic WAD.
IBT programs that include supervision may be a scalable and effective method of disseminating CBT into routine clinical practice, particularly for populations without ready access to more-traditional "live" methods of training. There was no evidence for a significant effect of IBT without supervision over a nontraining control, suggesting that merely providing access to IBT programs may not be an effective method of disseminating CBT to routine clinical practice.
Patients with either factor V Leiden or prothrombin mutations were not at an increased risk for postoperative graft occlusion or thromboembolic events. Patients heterozygous for MTHFR mutation had a lower risk of graft thrombosis and higher graft patency rates compared with both homozygous and wild-type control subjects. Patients homozygous for the MTHFR mutation had lower graft patency rates compared with patients who were heterozygous, and a trend was seen toward lower patency rates compared with wild-type control subjects. Therefore, screening for the MTHFR gene mutation before surgery may identify patients at an increased risk of graft thrombosis.
Psychiatrists exposed to strict conflict of interest policies prescribed heavily promoted antipsychotics at rates similar to academic psychiatrists and nonacademic psychiatrists exposed to less strict or no policies.
The superior diagnostic and therapeutic properties of the classical rigid endoscopy in this area underlines its still actual status in patients with suspected foreign body impaction.
Intracameral moxifloxacin injection seems to be safe systemically, but it may have toxic effects on corneal tissues, as suggested by oxidative stress parameters and a histopathological evaluation.
Patellar tendon repair using cortical button fixation demonstrated mechanical advantages over suture repair and anchor repair in cadaveric specimens. Cortical button fixation showed less cyclic gap formation and withstood at least twice the load to failure of the construct.
Follow-up abdominal CT scans are not routinely necessary in patients with splenic injuries managed nonoperatively.
After incomplete colonoscopy with a standard adult colonoscope, a further colonoscopy may be completed with same standard colonoscope or by using a gastroscope in the same session. A prior failed colonoscopy, particularly when stopped in the sigmoid tract, is significantly associated with a lower caecal intubation rate at second colonoscopy.
Topical application of nitroglycerine represents a new, easily handled, and effective alternative in the treatment of anal fissures. All of our patients reported a dramatic reduction in acute anal pain. However, it should be noted that a lack of sphincter tone reduction is a likely reason for the great tendency of chronic anal fissures to recur.
There is no significant difference between the occurrence of MH in preterm when compared with term infants. Routine contralateral exploration in preterm infants with its associated risks is therefore not justified in unilateral hernia.
Drinking profiles in early adulthood are an important predictor of receiving a disability pension later in life.
Recognised deficiencies in research method were not acknowledged. When submitting work for publication, investigators should provide evidence of how they searched for previous work.
Because patients infected with syphilis have relatively large numbers of anonymous sexual encounters, prevention strategies that supplement partner notification are urgently needed to control the syphilis epidemic among adults.
Our study showed that half of the patients with RA may have RC, a condition that was significantly associated with disease activity and low hip BMD, but not with VF.
Emergency physicians routinely requested BAC at admission but did not request alcohol kinetics while the patient was under observation. The discharge decision was based on clinical judgment. Doctors who do not advise patients appropriately before discharge may be guilty of negligence in their duty of care.
Gonococci with ceftriaxone and cefixime MICs of 0.125-0.25 mg/L are accumulating in the UK. These MICs lie on the edge of likely responsiveness to current regimens, which need review. Possible responses include: (i) higher cephalosporin doses; (ii) multidose cephalosporin regimens; (iii) multidrug regimens; (iv) microbiologically directed treatment; or, in the future, (v) drug cycling. The practicalities of these approaches are discussed.
The use of TRiM may assist in increasing the psychological resilience of military personnel through the facilitation of social support; this may have particular utility during operational deployments.
Hypocholesterolemia is not an independent risk factor for increased overall mortality in high-functioning community-dwelling older men and women. The association between low total cholesterol and high mortality observed in crude analysis is mainly confounded by common cardiovascular risk factors, rather than underlying inflammation or undernutrition.
There was no consistent evidence that students scored increasingly higher on OSCE stations repeated throughout the year. Thus, it would appear that a clerkship can repeat OSCE stations within an academic year without risk of a trend toward increasing scores.
Risk of PND among rural postnatal women was high (31.4%). Birth of female baby, poverty and complications in pregnancy or known medical illness could predict the high risk of PND. PND screening should be an integral part of postnatal care. Capacity building of grass root level workers and feasibility trials for screening PND by them are needed.
In spite of seemingly large differences in average birthweight among maternal countries of birth (range 3290-3677 g), knowledge of the maternal country of birth does not provide accurate information for ascertaining individual offspring birthweight because of the high inter-offspring heterogeneity around country averages. Our study exemplifies the need for a better understanding of individual health diversity for which group averages may provide insufficient and even misleading information. The analytical approach we outline is therefore relevant to investigations of country of birth (and ethnic) differences in health in general.
Although the high positivity to IgA-EmA and IgA-tTG emphasizes the importance of the serological screening in relatives of celiac patients, the discordances detected in this study showed that the use of only one method can lead to false negative results. Consequently these relatives will not be submitted to intestinal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease, and to the correct and earlier treatment.
A dual attending surgeon strategy was superior to a single surgeon strategy in posterior selective thoracic fusion in Lenke 1 and 2 AIS patients and will lead to a faster operation, reduced intraoperative blood loss, reduced risk of allogenic transfusion, reduced morphine requirement, and shorter hospital stay.
There was suboptimal stroke prevention with no difference between antiplatelet and OAC treated patients, perhaps reflecting an inappropriate Target INR range. On modeling analyses, the use of the NOACs (apixaban and dabigatran) could provide better stroke prevention compared to antiplatelet (or warfarin) use in this Chinese AF population, with a positive net clinical benefit.
Although we found no statistically significant difference in PFTs, or steroid requirements following ESS, ESS may have resulted in a reduced need for hospitalization in the 6 months following the procedure. Future prospective studies in a larger number of patients and using more detailed outcome measures are needed to better evaluate the effects of endoscopic sinus surgery in pediatric patients with CF.
Altogether, the data suggest that TSPO induction after ICH could be an intrinsic mechanism to prevent an exacerbated inflammatory response and raise the possibility of targeting TSPO for the attenuation of secondary brain injury after ICH.
The southern European cardiovascular middle-age mortality advantage extended to total mortality much more for women than for men. We suggest that forces behind this gender difference in this north/south mortality gradient include life style factors.
Authors poing out insufficiency of curettage as a method of endometrial biopsy prior to ablation. Using of the loop electrode may minimize the incidence of unrecognized malignancies.
Encasing covers and hot washing of bed linen reduced mite aeroallergen (and mattress cat allergen in the absence of cats). This could mean dual benefits to a patient sensitive to both mite and cat.
The test of maximal gait speed brings a help to decide to stop crutches only for speeds superior to 1.11 m/s.
Although breast cancer in younger Chinese patients was more aggressive pathologically, the differences between clinical presentation, tumour staging and survival were similar. Treatment strategies should follow the clinical condition of the patient rather than age alone.
ELAPE appears to confer oncological benefit over SAPE but with notable exceptions, including tumours located above and below the puborectalis sling and anteriorly at the level of prostate where exenteration may be more appropriate.
The PEEK-SP formulations evaluated in this study maintained favorable mechanical properties that merit further investigation into their use in load-bearing orthopaedic applications and supported greater in vitro osteogenic differentiation compared with smooth PEEK and Ti6Al4V. These results are independent of pore sizes ranging 200 µm to 508 µm.
Future studies should consider assessing other outcomes (e.g. knowledge, physician support) of the decision making process. There may be trade-offs between acknowledging uncertainty and immediate decision satisfaction.
Our experience and this study suggest that timing of silicone tube removal does not influence surgical success in EXT-DCR regardless of the cause of early or late tube removal.
A total reduction of almost 14 prescription days was observed over eight trimesters after implementation of the regulation to terminate the reimbursement of benzodiazepines. Short-term users were mainly responsible for this reduction in prescription days in 2009 and 2010. Although long-term users did not alter their benzodiazepine use in 2009 and 2010, the number of long-term users decreased slightly.
This population-based pharmacoepidemiological study including 13,355 women indicates that a protective association exists between OC use and the likelihood of sustaining an operatively treated ACL injury. Although this study does indicate a protective association of OC use, OC should not be used as a prophylactic measure before additional clinical studies have further clarified the biological and causal association between OC use and the likelihood of sustaining operatively treated ACL injury.
There is a positive association between the preferred chewing side and the more efficient side. Alternate unilateral mastication per se does not promote better masticatory performance than consistently unilateral mastication.
P. acnes has been isolated from prostatic tissues in men who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized cancer and has been shown to be positively associated with prostatic inflammation. This inflammation may then be linked to the evolution of carcinoma. Furthermore, organisms infecting these patients with prostate cancer differ genetically and phenotypically from the commonly identified cutaneous P. acnes isolates, suggesting that specific subtypes may be involved in development of prostatic inflammation.
IDET procedure can be a useful, safe, and cost-effective option in the management of carefully selected workers compensation claimants with chronic LBP of discogenic etiology.
In this controlled study, migraine, especially with aura, is more frequent in subjects with PFO. PFO closure is associated with a reduction in migraine frequency and severity, as well as an improvement in MIDAS scores. PFO closure was associated with a significant reduction in the use of abortive medications.
Women with intrapartum anal sphincter rupture can still suffer problems 20 years afterwards. In the follow-up of these women, information and support are essential and active tracing of such women is to be recommended.
The rapid improvement in these parameters may reflect both ascents in the learning curve and change in type of procedure. Adhesions, due to prior surgery or inflammation making dissection tedious, is the most important technical factor which effects operation time (p<0.001). However, despite increased complexity, operating time decreased, reflecting improved skills. Thus, the experienced laparoscopic surgeon can increase the spectrum of applications with expectations of shorter operations and lower complication rates.
Cleaning the surrounding skin with a cleanser rather than normal saline promotes the healing of pressure ulcers.
TAPP after prostatectomy is safe and effective. It seems that patients undergoing laparoscopic repair after radical prostatic resection have the same benefits as those without prostatectomy.
We conclude that neither the presence of pathologically positive nodes nor nodal stage is a prognostically significant factor for local control in patients who have undergone radical surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. We do not recommend a change in treatment philosophy, such as an increase in dose to the primary site, based on the pathologic status of the neck.
Physician estimate of biopsy specimen quality and the float sign are not helpful in predicting that the biopsy specimen contains abnormal or diagnostic tissue. Diagnostic biopsy specimen will likely be obtained if the size of the specimen fills the forceps, 2 to 4 biopsies are performed, and toothed forceps are used.
Although it is possible that FHR decelerations were markers for adverse outcomes, none of the infants delivered for decelerations had an abnormal cord gas. Because it may lead to pre-term delivery based on false positive testing, clinicians should use caution when prescribing prolonged FM.
MUAC is less affected by dehydration than WFLz and is therefore more suitable for nutritional assessment of ill children. However, both WFLz and MUAC misclassify SAM among dehydrated children. Nutritional status should be re-evaluated following rehydration, and management adjusted accordingly.
CPS are rarely calculated in the diagnosis of PE and the diagnostic algorithm is rarely used in clinical practice. This may result in procedures with potential significant side effects being unnecessarily performed or to a high risk of underdiagnosis.
Our study supports a possible association between MS, HL, NHL, and perhaps NPC all of which are associated with EBV infection.
The size of scotomas depends on the surface topography of the tested area. The prominent nasal part of the optic disc appears less "blind" than the shallow temporal part, probably due to more intensive light scattering by the prominent nasal part of the disc.
In this series, the percentage of boys circumcised and the prevalence of BXO were both higher than in other published series. BXO may be more common and present at a younger age than previously thought.
Despite Medicare, private insurance coverage appears to influence the likelihood of coronary revascularization among older patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction.
Pancreaticoduodenectomy may be justified for chronic pancreatitis presenting as periampullary mass, in terms of nonspecific clinical features, unreliable preoperative imaging studies, undependable intraoperative frozen-section biopsy and low surgical risk.
Liver transplantation in patients with otherwise surgically uncontrollable acute liver injury can be indicated as a life saving procedure and can be performed successfully in highly selected cases.
Based on the above figures and known prevalence rates of thalassaemia carriers, it would seem worthwhile to screen for globin gene mutations in partners of known thalassaemia carriers, regardless of MCV, to identify pregnancies at risk of Hb H disease or Hb E/beta thalassaemia.
Statins might exert significant renoprotective effects in CKD patients; however, benefit may depend on the duration of treatment. This is an issue that warrants more definitive investigation. More studies are necessary in dialysis patients to credibly evaluate the renal effects of statin therapy.
We found that the toxicity of Ag ENMs is not always size dependent. Strong cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were observed in cells exposed to Ag ENMs 50 nm, but Ag ENMs 200 nm had the most mutagenic potential. Additionally, we showed that expression of concentrations of ENMs in mass units is not representative. Number of ENMs or surface area of ENMs (per cm2) seem more precise units with which to compare the toxicity of different ENMs.
The results of this study indicate that the carotid artery plaques (fatty and mixed) significantly change according to whether analysis is performed before or after administration of contrast material.
HSU in the 12 months post-initial medical certification varied substantially according to the worker's condition, certificate type, age, gender and residential location. Understanding these factors can facilitate more appropriate resource allocation; strategic thinking on optimal use of particular health services and enables better targeting of particular provider groups for more education on the health benefits of RTW.
Good responses to sEBRT can be expected in patients with local recurrence without systemic progression or isolated PSA recurrence after initial hormonal therapy when the patients show both pre-sEBRT PSA<30.0 ng/ml and PSADT>7.0 months.
In the study population MI case-fatality reduction can be mainly attributed to a more effective and prompt management before hospitalisation and to an improvement in acute treatment during hospitalisation. This enhancement is made available to the whole population overtaking social differences.
Despite the operative risk involved, we believe that pancreatic resection should be considered in selected patients with good performance status, stable disease and isolated pancreatic metastases.
SFHCC patients with hypertension received pharmacotherapy as recommended by JNC 7 guidelines and were at the blood pressure goal set by Healthy People 2010.
A woman's alcohol intake is associated with decreased fecundability even among women with a weekly alcohol intake corresponding to five or fewer drinks. This finding needs further corroboration, but it seems reasonable to encourage women to avoid intake of alcohol when they are trying to become pregnant.
A "knowledge-practice gap" does appear to exist in anaesthesia teaching in spite of the improved medical education evidence base. KT methodology may provide a guide to improving clinician engagement with medical education.
Our findings raise questions about whether the clinical conditions represented by ICD-9-CM codes used by the Complications Screening Program were in fact always present. These findings highlight concerns about the clinical validity of using ICD-9-CM codes for quality monitoring.
The present study shows an absence of sex differences in WM in healthy subjects and in patients with schizophrenia. However, in the dual task and in the single visual subtest, female patients performed worse than males. This finding suggests that in contrast to males, nonacute female inpatients show an underlying attentional deficit that may contribute to impairment in higher-order functions such as EC.
As a rule, anatomically and functionally competent valves in the proximal IJV are present. In human beings, they obstruct the direct retrograde inlet to the intracranial venous system, which suggests an unbalanced and unreliable perfusion of the brain. Therefore, retrograde cerebral perfusion by cannulating the superior vena cava may help flushing out embolism and supporting 'the cold jacket' of the brain. However, its effect of retrograde backflow cannot be a sign of adequate cerebral perfusion.
Our cases and a review of the literature indicate that the histological diagnosis of MCA may comprise different pathogenetic entities. From the clinical point of view, MCA has to be regarded as a minimal change nephrotic syndrome with symptomatic or asymptomatic mesangial IgA deposition. IgA deposition constitutes a risk factor for impairment of renal function and indicates a frequently relapsing course.
This study does not support the hypothesis that either long or short IPI is a risk factor for later cardiovascular health.
By including the effects of over diagnosing and treating CT, we have demonstrated how the risks and benefits of empiric and nonempiric cervicitis therapy vary in relationship to CT prevalence. Failure to consider both the physical and the psychological aspects of patient well-being may mean that well-intentioned policies to reduce physical morbidity do not result in an overall improvement in health of teenagers.
Our results suggest that there is no relationship between BRCA1 mutation and pancreatic cancer development in Polish population.
Type 2 diabetes seems to positively affect the mineral density of the trabecular bone in women with premature menopause. The duration of diabetes does not appear to influence bone mass.
The diastase resistant PAS-positive structures are compatible with intracellular bacteria. After gastric MALT-lymphoma and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma it appears that Hodgkin's disease and sclerosing mediastinal B-cell lymphomas may also be human tumors related bacteria.
Fragmentation seemed not to influence clinical outcomes of intravitreal dexamethasone implantation during 6 months or to alter the frequency of adverse events.
In this cohort of patients receiving PRBC in the resuscitation room, factors related primarily to injury severity were associated with pulmonary morbidity and mortality, but C/PRBC was not. Pertaining to initial resuscitation, the purported benefit of crystalloid limitation was not observed.
There was an inverse association between the patient safety culture and adverse events. Until the criterion validity of the tools for measuring patient safety culture and tracking of adverse events have been further evaluated, measurement of patient safety culture could not be used as a proxy for the "true" safety.
There is a strong evidence base for using SAB rates to measure the impact of infection control programs that are assessed during accreditation. However, there is less evidence to support whether accreditation scores accurately reflect implementation of the infection control accreditation standards. This impacts identification of indicators to measure patient safety and quality of care, especially in ensuring these are appropriate across a range of hospital size and activities.
In mild cognitive impairment, depression signs are a better marker of longitudinal cortical atrophy than apathy. Results are consistent with hypotheses that depression is an early sign of a more aggressive neurodegenerative process or that depression lowers brain reserve capacity, allowing for more rapid progression of Alzheimer disease neuropathology.
In women who presented at 28-36 weeks of gestation with TPL, cAGV and FZE can be used as independent predictors of PTB.
Cerebral autoregulation showed to be disturbed in 35% of post-CA patients of which a majority had pre-CA hypertension. Disturbed cerebral autoregulation within the first 24h after CA is associated with a worse outcome. In contrast to uniform MAP goals, the time spent under a patient tailored optimal MAP, based on an index of autoregulation, was negatively associated with survival.
The present study revealed sex-specific differences in heavy smoking by age at smoking onset, which was not shown before so far. These findings should be further investigated and addressed in future prevention campaigns.
Rasch analysis based on small samples (≤ 50) identified a greater number of items with incorrectly ordered parameters than larger samples (≥ 100). However, fewer items were identified as misfitting. Results from small samples led to opposite conclusions from those based on larger samples. Rasch analysis based on small samples should be used for exploratory purposes with extreme caution.
Only 8% of the airports surveyed provided the minimum requirements for a lactation room. However 62% stated they were breastfeeding friendly. Airports need to be educated as to the minimum requirements for a lactation room.
This study is among the largest to examine patients with IBC by race. Being Caucasian or African American did not appear to impact treatment adherence. However, African American patients tended to have poorer response to standard treatment and worse outcome than Caucasian patients.
Coagulation and platelet function are impaired by all 3 colloids. However, in vitro gelatin-induced coagulopathy was significantly more reversible than HES-induced coagulopathy.
The site of the reservoir does not significantly influence the outcome after total gastrectomy and reconstruction with a preserved duodenal passage.
Despite treatment, initial mortality and severe disability remain high. Nevertheless, a favourable outcome was achieved in 26 % of aggressively treated patients, rendering the withdrawal of maximal therapy for WFNS grade V SAH patients unacceptable today. In cases of old patients with IVH, the indication for aggressive therapy should be put in place more carefully due to a very poor prognosis.
These cases suggest that prolapsed aortic cusp complicating a malalignment perimembranous ventricular septal defect is not always an absolute indication for early surgery to prevent progressive aortic regurgitation.
Even in the presence of universal coverage and very optimistic scenarios regarding the effect of insurance on mammography for newly insured women, mammography rates would only increase a small amount and gaps in screening would remain. Thus, a Medicare buy-in could be expected to have a small impact on mammography screening rates.
PCNL is a safe and effective procedure for the management of lower pole caliceal calculi after a single unsuccessful SWL session. This procedure should be considered the primary method for the treatment of lower pole stones.
The study results demonstrate that the division of the interlobar fissure in pulmonary lobectomy with BiClamp(®) is safe and feasible in most cases. While the results point out the limitation that division of the right upper or middle lobe may still be a challenge, they show the potential benefit of staple reduction. Less use of staples results in reduced medical costs and carbon dioxide emission, contributing to 'ecosurgery', which ultimately conserves the global environment.
Low-risk nulliparae in spontaneous labour giving birth at the level 4 hospital in this health service are at significantly increased risk of caesarean section. This may have implications for the organisation and resource management of other level 4 public maternity units. Care in a tertiary (level 6) service may not necessarily equate to the higher rates of intervention reported by others.
Although the scapular notching rate was significantly higher in the standard RSA group, no other outcome measures were statistically different, including range of motion, strength, and validated outcome scores.
The meta-analysis suggests a clinically relevant and statistically significant beneficial effect of intracisternal thrombolysis. However, the results of the analysis are limited by the predominance of nonrandomized studies. Further randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of high-risk patients would be justified.
The foregoing data illustrate the potential of effluent MMP-2 and PAI-1 as biomarkers of peritoneal modifications, especially fibrosis; however, the components of peritoneal transport and local production should be clearly distinguished in every patient.
In patients without risk factors for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and a normal Papanicolaou smear in pregnancy, a Papanicolaou smear should be repeated at the recommended yearly interval.
The individual perception of bronchial symptoms is highly variable among perennial allergic rhinitis patients. The lack of a maximal airway-narrowing plateau is related to the presence of sputum eosinophilia, which might be useful in the detection of patients susceptible to anti-inflammatory therapy. Prospective studies evaluating whether these patients are more likely to develop symptomatic asthma in the future and if the early anti-inflammatory treatment prevents its development are needed.
It is possible to derive a limited evaluation that is still sufficient for patient management. The prior results were confirmed and led to better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of retrospective studies.
Discrepant FA changes after the same irradiation dose suggest radiosensitivity of the frontal lobe white matter compared with the parietal lobe. Special efforts to address the potentially vulnerable frontal lobe after treatment with whole-brain radiation may be needed so as to balance disease control and treatment-related morbidity.
The comparability of optic nerve sheath diameter measurements in patients without known optic nerve disease and assumed normal intracranial pressure appears to be given between computed tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, while comparability between ultrasound and computed tomography or magnetic resonance tomography seems to be less reliable.
PM was effective for diagnosing OSAS in the elderly and can be used as an alternative to PSG in elderly patients with a high clinical probability of OSAS.
ART was the leading adjuvant management strategy for CSIS, but its share drastically decreased with a concomitant increase in surveillance and AC, particularly after 2004. These trends were similar in both academic and community settings. The current level of ART, although decreasing, may nevertheless lead to additional cases of solid cancer comparable with testicular cancer deaths.
PSAV does not improve the detection characteristics of a PSA cut-off of 4.0 ng/ml in secondary screening after four years.
Targeted and universal interventions need to encourage peers and family members to actively engage with young adolescents experiencing depressive symptoms rather than waiting for them to initiate help-seeking. This is particularly important for adolescents experiencing higher levels of depressive symptoms who may not initiate help-seeking themselves.
Our study showed that preoperative nutrition is beneficial in decreasing the complications and chest tube removal time in non-small cell lung cancer patients that were applied anatomic resection with a reduction of 25 % in the postoperative albumin levels of non-malnourished patients who underwent resection.
The studies to be included in meta-analyses, particularly comparing ACEIs and ARBs, should be chosen carefully.
The liver stiffness measurement is a possible predictor of intraoperative blood loss through the correlation between liver stiffness measurement and the intraoperative blood loss during right hepatectomy.
These data support the conclusion that the increase in uterine blood flow observed during pregnancy is controlled largely by local factors induced by pregnancy.
The findings suggest that CS(2) poisoning may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome.
This study confirms that PFC is an effective technique for the treatment of the urogenital prolapsed. On the anatomical levelresults are less good for the posterior compartment. On the functional level, our results do not plead in favour of an improvement of anorectal disorders.
There is a positive relationship between the time scheduled for therapy and therapy outcomes. These data suggest that large doses of therapy lead to clinically meaningful improvements, controlling for time after stroke. Currently, trials report time scheduled for therapy as a measure of therapy dose. Preferable measures of dose would be active time in therapy or repetitions of an exercise.
In patients with stable, moderate CHF, plasma levels of ANP, BNP, and norepinephrine measured at peak exercise did not improve risk stratification. However, in addition to percent of maximal predicted oxygen consumption and left atrial diameter, plasma level of BNP at rest was an independent predictor of survival in CHF patients with low risk of cardiac events.
It seems possible to improve some aspects of male bladder function by drinking more water. However, the effects are too small to be clinically relevant.
This randomized controlled trial could not show a significant difference in clinical pregnancy rate between the aspirin and the placebo group in a first or second IVF/ICSI cycle. Given the lack of evidence for a beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin, it appears that low-dose aspirin should not be prescribed routinely in IVF/ICSI treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00644085.
Any degree of preoperative kidney impairment, even mild asymptomatic disease, is associated with clinically significant increases in 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality following major abdominal surgery.
The common presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in peripheral autonomic neurons may represent an early presymptomatic phase in the development of Lewy body disorders.
These data show that WBC-Tc99m scanning can be useful in distinguishing discontinuous from continuous colitis.
There seems to be a lack of consistent undergraduate training in burns management and final year students lack the experience and knowledge to initially manage burns.
PML test resulted useful in detecting higher number of hyperhomocysteinemic AD patients who may have the chance of an early folate treatment.
The presence of renal disease should also be considered as one potential cause of supra elevated levels of free beta-hCG in addition to the possibility of paternally derived triploidy and trisomy 21.
These findings provide further justification for researchers to specifically design studies to examine change in alliance as a mechanism of change in alcohol treatments.
Our findings indicate that degeneration of subchondral bone, cartilage, and meniscus probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis with crosstalk.
This study demonstrates that the CPB machine can be safely omitted when a long-term VAD is implanted on VA-ECMO support. Blood loss in the first 24 h after surgery was less and a significantly lower number of blood products were necessary in these patients compared with patients in whom the CPB machine was used. However, similar survival rates between these two groups were observed.
Decreasing the risk for SSIs requires a multifaceted "care bundle" approach, and this meta-analysis of current, pooled, peer-reviewed, randomized controlled trials suggests a clinical effectiveness of antimicrobial-coated sutures (triclosan) in the prevention of SSIs, representing Center for Evidence-Based Medicine level 1a evidence.
Visual impairments influence motor problems in VLBW adolescents, whereas motor problems in SGA adolescents seem to be unaffected by visual impairments.
Reducing the oxygen to 50% at resuscitation did not influence either short or long term outcomes, but a small benefit could not be excluded. There was no increase in adverse clinical outcomes in babies who received 100% oxygen.
CTM was still useful in diagnosis of the foraminal stenosis and bony lesion comparing with MRI but showed limitation in disc abnormality and nerve root compression. So even though CTM may provide valuable additional information in difficult or ambiguous cases, it also requires universal standards and sound experience for constant and objective information.
Patients who undergo pancreatic duct stenting and require surgical drainage at a later point have a threefold increased risk for peri-operative complications. An increase in intra-abdominal complications might be related to stent associated pancreatic duct injuries, stent occlusion, and bacterial colonization of the stent.
Use of Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group guidelines indicates that sonographic EFW is slightly to moderately useful in detecting fetal growth restriction in patients with chronic hypertension.
Voluntary use of a surgical simulation lab leads to minimal participation in a training curriculum. Participation should be mandatory if it is to be an effective part of a residency curriculum.
There was a 32% reduction in the incidence of distracted driving postintervention, which remained low even at 6-month follow-up. Implementation of an effective injury prevention campaign could reduce the incidence of distracted driving nationally.
If we encountered a young HCC patient, the patient will probably be a male HBV carrier. He would probably have larger tumor and is more likely to expire within 1 year than the older HCC patients. However, if the young HCC patient can survive for more than 1 year, he would probably have better survival in the following years than the older patients.
The prognosis of children with neuroblastoma tumours, which have been radiologically classified as nephroblastoma, is inferior compared to the prognosis of patients without preoperative nephroblastoma therapy. The difference appears to be associated rather with more unfavourable biology than with the element "preoperative chemotherapy".
The results indicate that the PI may be used for stratification of patients treatment prior surgery. However, these results need further validation in larger patient numbers in the search for factors indicating response pretherapeutically to preoperative chemoradiation in esophageal cancer.
More extensive risk adjustment changes quality ranking of nursing homes and should be considered as potential improvement to the current QMs. Other methodological issues related to construction of the QMs should also be investigated to determine if they are important in the context of nursing home care.
Patients with AVMs on EGD have an increased risk of jejunal AVMs on CE, particularly if they are elderly. Future studies should validate these findings in a prospective cohort.
Press releases from academic medical centers often promote research that has uncertain relevance to human health and do not provide key facts or acknowledge important limitations.
IDET procedure can be a useful, safe and cost-effective option in the management of carefully selected workers' compensation claimants with chronic low back pain of discogenic etiology.
Transfusion of packed red blood cells increases the risk of developing VAP. Avoiding the unnecessary use of packed red blood cell transfusions may decrease the occurrence of VAP.
The female population described here understands the campaign but their dietary behaviours do not appear to conform to the low-fat message.
The results show that patients who suffered a traumatic experience have the same level of sexual functioning (or the same incidence of sexual dysfunction) regardless of the severity of PTSD. Treatment with SSRIs helps reduce sexual problems in patients with subthreshold PTSD symptoms.
IMT was greater in HIV patients compared to age-matched controls but it appears that premature atherosclerosis has no additional impact on the evolution of neuropsychological deficits in HIV patients. IMT did not correlate with the severity of immunodeficiency.
The use of antibiotic nails for treatment of tibial infections seems to be a reasonable option, clearing 76% of infections at the 6-month time frame. Further investigation is needed to compare this treatment algorithm with other strategies, such as antibiotic treatment without nail removal and massive débridement with ring fixator placement.
In our experience, the rate of pT0 tumours after RP is 0.5%. The combination of clinical stage, preoperative PSA, number of positive biopsy cores, Gleason score, and prostate weight could help to predict pT0 stage after RP.
Admissions at fully accredited hospitals were associated with a shorter LOS compared with admissions at partially accredited hospitals, although the difference was modest. No difference was observed in AR within 30 days after discharge.
Clinical history, physical examination and severity of radiographic knee OA are of limited value over generic factors when trying to predict which older adults with knee pain will experience progressive or persistent functional difficulties.
Resorbable screws can be used effectively for fixation of BSSO for mandibular advancement. A higher incidence of rotation around positional screws can result secondary to the mechanical "looseness" when using resorbable screws. This can be treated effectively using Class III mechanic elastics during the initial stages of bone healing.
Patients who have concomitant severe conduction disturbances and significant coronary disease may well receive a pacemaker before a revascularization procedure. Our data shows that coronary revascularization has little, if any, impact on returning to normal AV conduction.
This case of plurihormonal thyrotropinoma is unique in having hypersecretion of TSH, GH, and FSH with low alpha-subunit. Such a combination may represent a new subentity of TSHomas.
Although Francophone doctors with a rural background were more likely than their urban counterparts to set up their first practice in a rural community, this effect was not sustained. This raises questions as to why they leave rural communities and highlights the importance of measures to retain doctors as a way to promote public health for underserved rural groups.
Continuation of smoking after treatment of laryngeal cancer is an independent negative prognostic factor. From a clinical standpoint, all patients with known laryngeal cancer should be strongly encouraged to quit smoking.
For patients with scirrhous gastric carcinoma, palliative resection should not be attempted for poor outcome. However, if curative resection seems feasible, radical surgery would be justified, especially for tumors without serosal exposure.
Except for general health perceptions and vitality, the HRQoL of prostate cancer survivors with or without DM was comparable to a normative population. Survivorship selection can possibly explain, in part, why patients with DM did not report worse generic or disease-specific HRQoL than those without DM, as had been expected.
This study demonstrated that despite positive short-term effects at six months, the telephone follow-up intervention had no long-term effects on health-related quality of life or secondary endpoints. However, the potential for improvement beyond six months was less than anticipated reflecting a reduced morbidity among acute myocardial infarction patients.
This study shows minor differences in process markers and no difference in clinical outcomes between patients in a clinical trial and patients receiving protocol driven care. The benefits of improved clinical care that have previously been associated with being in a trial may be explained by the use of clear clinical protocols. In routine practice, patients may be well advised to insist on treatment as part of a protocol.
Rapid recovery from acoustic trauma was temporally correlated with urodynamic and cardiovascular reactions from ingesting food containing sulfite preservative, a substance to which the individual was allergic. Factors that may have contributed to recovery of function include massive diuresis, increased heart rate, release of biochemical mediators, mediator-induced vasodilatation, and changes in vascular or cell membrane permeability. Establishing relationships that lead to recovery of function from acoustic trauma may facilitate research and aid in the development of new treatment options for this condition.
The majority of the studied patients tolerated etanercept for longer than 6 months. Many of these patients were able to subsequently taper or even discontinue corticosteroid and methotrexate therapy. Serious infections occurred in this patient population. Our results underscore the value of long-term observation under the conditions of clinical practice beyond controlled clinical trials.
Blood donations infected with Plasmodium can transmit malaria to donation recipients. Malaria diagnostic methods are currently available, but the feasibility criteria for mass screening in endemic areas become preponderant. Detection of the pLDH antigen seems to be an adequate screening tool in endemic areas, for this antigen indicates parasite presence. Routine screening of all donated blood would prevent infected blood donations and reduce P. falciparum transmission in critical patients, such as children and pregnant women. This tool would also decrease medical prophylaxis in donation recipients and contribute to lower Plasmodium resistance.
Graduating general surgical residents indicated a significant lack of confidence in performing specific open vascular surgical maneuvers. This decreased confidence varied regionally and was associated with both demographic and program-specific factors.
MoM HRA could be clinically advantageous and cost-effective in younger men and women. Further research on the comparative effectiveness of MoM HRA versus THA should include assessments of the quality of life and resource use in addition to the clinical outcomes associated with both procedures.
The number of pertussis cases seen in our centre has risen significantly in the last year. More than half (57%) of the patients were fully vaccinated, and 76.9% had received the last dose in the previous 4years. Other vaccination strategies, such as vaccination of adolescents, adults, and pregnant women, as well as a cocoon strategy are required to protect infants under 6months of age. More effective vaccines need to be developed.
Survival of children with Down syndrome continues to improve, and there is an overall survival figure of 90% to at least 5 years of age. It is clear from this study that prenatal screening technologies are not differentially ascertaining fetuses with Down syndrome and additional defects, because there has been no proportional increase in births of isolated cases with Down syndrome.
Placement and indwelling of PICCs are a potential risk factor for candidal sepsis among VLBW and ELBW infants.
Herniotomy was found to be safe, applicable, beneficial, and cost-effective in this age group, with many advantages over Bassini's herniorrhaphy.
Obstetric palsy patients with shoulder sequela who had a preoperative abduction less than 90 degrees hadas good functional results using latissimus dorsi, teres major muscle transfer and subscapularis muscle release as the patients who hada preoperative abduction greater than 90 degrees.
TBI disrupts core PS and WM abilities that scaffold more complex abilities. Importantly, slowed PS was associated with WM deficits commonly identified following pediatric TBI. Implications of our findings regarding the relation between PS and WM may suggest interventions for children and adolescents following TBI.
The process of updating the NLHS in Israel is unique and not without merit. Changes in the priority-setting process should be made to increase its acceptability among the different stakeholders.
This study suggests that a strategy to determine the extent of the groin dissection that is based on the location of the second-tier nodes may be valid.
Pre-eclampsia and/or IUGR as well as neonatal thrombosis are both associated with fetal thrombotic vasculopathy in the placenta. However, in our selected-tertiary centre-population, FTV did not predict neonatal thrombosis. The thrombophilic investigations of parents and children were incomplete. A standard approach for evaluating parents at risk for FTV and evaluating neonates at risk for thrombosis should be developed.
The results highlight the need to promote cholesterol and blood sugar measurement for lower SE groups, and pneumococcus immunization for the entire elderly population. Influenza immunization seems to be equally spread among different SE groups.
Intraoperative placement of the nasoenteric feeding tube may be a reasonable option for treating the surgical patient at nutritional risk who faces a limited course of impaired oral intake postoperatively.
H. pylori was not specifically identified in our patients with IHPS. The presence of H. pylori-like organisms in the gastric mucosa in our index case and finding of chronic active gastritis in several others may indicate the possibility of an acquired infectious etiology for IHPS.
Interference with the endocrine system was the predominant effect of the test compounds. A substitution of BPA with these structural analogues should be carried out with caution.
Changes in both body sway and stance phase of gait were larger in DNP than CMT1A, indicating more impaired static and dynamic control of balance when neuropathy affects the small in addition to the large afferent fibres. Diminished somatosensory input from the smaller fibres rather than muscle weakness or foot deformity plays a critical role in the modulation of the support phase of gait.
Unlike other fields of science, open access thus far has not affected how ophthalmology articles are cited in the literature.
The number of TLESRs is reduced significantly by antireflux surgery. Even accounting for increased basal and nadir pressures, the incidence of TLESR is reduced, suggesting that there may be additional mechanisms involved in this process.
GPs are aware of mental health problems in most depressed patients, but labeling with specific diagnostic codes is weak. Researchers should consider that diagnostic coding alone is not an accurate measure of the diagnostic ability of depression and strongly underestimates the accuracy of the GP.
The magnitude of this force was too small to account for the difference in IOP measurements. The Tonojet was less hydrophilic than the Goldmann, and the contact angle of the fluid was therefore greater. For a given tear film, less hydrophilic tonometers will tend to have thicker mires, and this may lead to underestimation of the IOP. When such disposable tonometers are used, it is recommended care should be taken to reject readings from thick mires.
Due to the difficulties in attaining reliable assessment of quality of life using psychometric questionnaires, the further proof of validity obtained in this study allows us to propose the re-evaluation of the role of the uniscale in measuring the quality of life of cancer patients.
ADT initiation has fallen and marked changes occurred in treatment patterns for prostate cancer. Changes might be driven by increasing awareness of potential harms and costs, and by new evidence supporting ADT for specific indications.
Although appropriate patient selection and careful perioperative management are mandatory, bilateral pulmonary lobectomy could be an acceptable procedure for patients with bilateral lung cancers.
Oral administration of nitric oxide donors significantly reduced bladder outlet obstruction due to detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia suggesting a role for nitric oxide in inhibitory neurotransmission to the urethral sphincter. This new approach could offer a potential pharmacological option to treat detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in spinal cord injured patients.
Quinolones may cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. The time interval from antibiotic ingestion to onset of the condition may be much longer in quinolones than in penicillin derivatives.
Patients who have International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade 1 or 2 endometrioid corpus cancer with greatest surface dimension<or =2 cm, myometrial invasion<or =50%, and no intraoperative evidence of macroscopic disease can be treated optimally with hysterectomy only.
Risk factors for malignancy in a MNG included male gender, younger age, fewer nodules, and smaller nodule size. The low predictive value of FNA in our population suggests there needs to be better ways to predict malignancy in patients with MNG. Therefore, these clinical risk factors should be considered when consulting patients with MNG in regards to their risk of malignancy.
The SAMMPRIS results do not provide evidence to support the use of PTAS using the Wingspan stent system compared with medical treatment in any examined subpopulation of patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis, including those with qualifying event hypoperfusion symptoms.
PSV-VG did not offer any ventilatory advantage over SIMV in the initial management of surfactant-treated premature newborns with RDS except for minimizing the number of blood gases.
This preliminary study suggests that the presence of hepatic lipidosis and LG has no demonstrable effect on development of acquired shunts or the magnitude of increase in liver volume after attenuation of congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in dogs.
Although the UNGASS global reporting system now comprises an unequaled wealth of data on HIV responses, collected from a broad range of countries, it cannot yet answer several critical questions about the progress and effectiveness of those responses. Evaluation studies that go beyond indicator monitoring are needed, but they will take time to design, fund, implement and interpret. In the meantime, this global monitoring system provides a good indication of the overall progress in the global response to HIV and whether Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6 (to halt and reverse the HIV epidemic) is likely to be reached by 2015.
Chemotherapy and pleurectomy/decortication can extend the survival time of patients with MPM remarkably. The adequate treatment options have to be tailored to the specific particular needs of each patient considering histological subtype, tumour stage and patient's individual functional assessment as well as comorbidity.
CT can be replaced by US when complex effusions are present in children with pneumonia. In case of an ambiguous diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia with or without complex effusions, a combination of chest radiography and US is a reliable surrogate for chest CT.
Increased plasma endothelin concentrations in patients with congestive heart failure appears to serve as a predictor of cardiac death.
The CDX2, COX2 and MUC2 expressions were seen in the intestinal epithelium having goblet cells. The use of the markers in the diagnosis is controversial but the difference in the Barrett esophagus-dysplasia sequence seems to be meaningful.
The recognized difficulties still cause a loss of time and in some cases complications, which can only partly be compensated by the surgeon's experience. This leads to reluctance in the application of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in more complicated stages of the disease. Two-dimensional view satisfies the surgeon's demands for a safe procedure.
The experience of the PCC described here offers a unique approach to improving end-of-life care for those outpatients who may not be well served by existing structures of care such as palliative care consult services and who have not yet enrolled in hospice.
Delay secondary to abdominal imaging in patients who require operative intervention results in an independent higher risk of mortality. ABD CT imaging is an important and useful tool after injury; however, these results suggest that delay caused by overreliance on ABD CT may result in poor outcome in specific patients. Clinicians who take care of critically injured patients should be aware of and understand these potential risks.
Although the vast majority of people with spinal cord injury reported they wished to receive written information, a small proportion of patients did not wish to receive such information. Acceptance of written information is not universal and clinicians must ensure that provision of written information to people with spinal cord injury should be tailored to the needs of individual patients.
Puncture may increase the risk of intra-articular adhesion in patients with internal derangement.
A PC is not needed for patient safety. However, in some patients, a PC is helpful to optimize stimulation amplitudes and to increase the patients' own perception of safety.
Routine pertussis vaccination of adolescents results in net health benefits and may be relatively cost-effective.
Even if bladder wall thickness is measured at specifically defined bladder volumes, it cannot predict videourodynamic findings other than bladder trabeculation in children with spina bifida.
This study strengthens the case for a causal relationship between smoking and coeliac disease by demonstrating a strong, temporally appropriate and dose-dependent effect, thus meeting the Bradford Hill criteria. This suggests that cigarette smoking truly protects against the development of adult coeliac disease.
These findings indicate that age is not a relevant confounding factor for SERT availability as measured by (11)C-(+)McN5652 PET in healthy adults up to the age of about 35 y.
ICU tours are included in many cardiac surgery educational programs. The majority of patients in this study perceived a benefit or a future benefit from an ICU tour, even though the tour did not significantly reduce the anxiety of the patients or family members.
Use of older donors (≥50 yr) in older recipients (≥60 yr) results in lower five-yr survival and freedom from CAV. Caution is required in these cases. Larger studies are warranted to confirm findings.
Voucher schemes increased deliveries in health centres and, to a lesser extent, improved antenatal and postnatal care. However, schemes that targeted poorer women did not appear to be efficient since these women were more likely than less poor women to be encouraged to give birth in a public health-care facility, even with universal voucher schemes.
There are no distinctive morphologic features in the pattern of lung disease measured by computed tomographic scanning performed with the patient in the supine position that can predict response to the prone position.
Patients with prior alcohol septal ablation undergoing surgical septal myectomy may have an increased risk of cardiac death, advanced heart failure, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator discharges. This supports septal myectomy as the preferred treatment for septal reduction therapy, avoiding scarring and diastolic dysfunction inherent to alcohol septal ablation.
Our results show that the decline of eGFR in the DN of T2D is not directly influenced by BMI and that the major risk factors contributing to this decline remain low-baseline eGFR and increased baseline albuminuria.
The results of the study suggested that low calcium intake could reduce the bone accretion rates and increase the risk of osteoporosis in the subjects of the present study. Calcium rich food may be recommended for women in both groups.
This study presents evidence of the hierarchy of loss in a younger population than previously observed suggesting that targeted interventions to prevent functional decline should not be delayed until old age.
The high inter- and intra-individual variation in antidepressant prescribing could not be linked with personal, structural or morbidity patterns, and the heavy influence of pharmaceutical industry could not be ruled out.
Vesical urine undergoes changes in some of its components during its passage through the urethra. These findings presumably indicate that the urethral urothelium is a functioning epithelium and also that voided and vesical urine are not identical. The study raises the question to what extent is the analysis of voided urine representative of that of vesical urine?
An encouraging and supportive attitude on the part of the professionals is essential for empowering people to handle obstacles during the rehabilitation process; whereas feeling rejected and belittled in the return to work process may lead to disempowerment, and/or delays in measures and longer periods on sick leave.
TVES was a useful technique in confirming the diagnoses of cervical cancer and in estimating the infiltrating region. When the strain ratio of a cervical lesion was higher than 4.53, it is confidential to be diagnosed as malignant.
Patient-specific instrumentation for TKA shows slight improvement in operating room time management but none in component alignment postoperatively. Therefore, routine use of this new technology may not be cost-effective in its current form.
We propose that 10 to 12 mm LCAs generate enough HG to secure a single strand when clips are placed at the angle position. This is especially true over PDS (hard) strands. The application of 5 mm LCA clips to secure the end of the Vicryl strand is not recommended. Further clinical studies are warranted.
Within Australia, policies that increase the price of alcohol are about equally effective in relative terms for reducing alcohol consumption both for the general population and among those who drink heavily.
Deprivation impacts on the use of paediatric Emergency Departments for non-urgent care even in countries like Australia where there is government subsidized health care.
Positron emission tomography, when utilized judiciously, remained an ancillary tool in the surgical selection of one-third of patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, although its utility as an independent tool is not very promising.
Eating a meal was associated with a small fall in median SaO(2) among stroke and elderly patients, but only in stroke patients did this persist for at least 10 minutes after eating. A quarter of stroke patients had episodes in which the SaO(2) fell to</=90% saturation (ie, hypoxemia) during or after eating, although this rarely coincided exactly with swallowing and was more common in patients who also experienced desaturation during the baseline recordings. Further studies are required to establish whether these changes are clinically important.
Cerebral salt wasting is associated with elevated plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP. Natriuretic peptides may play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
African-American women are less likely to receive adequate mammographic screening than white women, which may explain the higher prevalence of advanced breast tumors among African-American women. Tumor characteristics may also contribute to differences in cancer outcomes because African-American women have higher-grade tumors than white women regardless of screening. These results suggest that adherence to recommended mammography screening intervals may reduce breast cancer mortality rates.
BRAF mutation is not associated with interval cancers but is a marker of poor prognosis, particularly in microsatellite stable cancers.
Sonographic assessment of cervical length has better diagnostic accuracy in the prediction of preterm delivery compared to digital examination in a low-risk population.
Although these findings require replication in other epidemiologically based first-admission samples, at face value they do not support the suggestion of a psychotoxic effect of prolonged exposure to untreated psychosis.
LTx can be a curative approach for patients with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis. However, organ shortage is a major limiting factor in the selection of HCC patients for LTx.
Both drugs are effective in inducing remission. AZA seems to be more effective in maintaining remission. The onset of therapeutic effect is delayed less under MMF. Both drugs have steroid sparing potential, which is delayed under AZA. It seems that AZA still is the immunouppressant of choice in chronic active CD, but MMF is a reasonable alternative in patients who do not tolerate AZA.
Lower levels of vitamin D may be associated with further increases in total and CVD mortality associated with COPD; however, age and cardiovascular risk factors appear to explain much of this association.
Approximately one third of the patients in our survey were found to have an optimal HRQoL. While unsatisfactory disease control was the primary reason why the remainder failed to attain optimal HRQoL, it is clear that illness perception and mood also played parts. Therefore, therapeutic plans should be directed not only toward achieving the best possible clinical control of asthma and comorbid rhinitis, but also to incorporating individualized elements according to patient-related characteristics.
The prevalence of p.(Ser64Arg) mutation is low in the general population as is the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in mutation carriers (1/10). Atrial fibrillation in the affected mutated patient was lone at onset and progressively evolved with peculiar electrophysiological patterns.
The above findings revealed that equol itself or some unknown factor regulating the metabolism of daidzein is deeply involved in the biology of prostate cancer. Future studies are urgently needed to compare the incidence of daidzein metabolizers among various countries.
This study confirms that CA 125 changes in patients receiving paclitaxel treatment do not correlate with response allocations according to WHO criteria. In particular, patients with clinically and radiologically defined progression will often not show an increase in CA 125 concentrations from baseline. Those patients who do show doubling of CA 125 values, however, have a very poor prognosis. The CA 125 ratio, as determined after 4 courses of paclitaxel treatment, may be a better indicator of response than WHO defined response status.
The prevalence of anemia in pregnancy is still high in our setting. Quality ANC appeared a valuable preventive intervention that should be made widely available, accessible and affordable to all pregnant women.
Listeria is an uncommon cause of neonatal SBI in febrile neonates who presented to the ED. Empiric use of ampicillin may need to be reconsidered if national data confirm very low listeria and enterococcal prevalence and high ampicillin resistance patterns.
Women and newborns with serious obstetric complications have a greater chance of successful outcomes if they are immediately directed to a functioning referral hospital and if the providers are responsive.
Sampling from the prostatic TZ by directed needle biopsies at repeated SPB was associated with a very low incidence of PCa (2.5%), especially if compared to TURP (19% detection rate), and could be omitted.
Declining trends in premarital sex and multiple partnerships are among the factors that might explain the decrease in HIV incidence in Zambia among young people. However, condom use among young people has remained low and stable over the years. The results also suggest that behaviour change interventions should take stock of the social context when introducing individual-level programmes because neighbourhood factors play a considerable role in influencing sexual behaviour.
(68)Ga-DOTATATE PET is a reliable predictor of tumor growth in WHO grades I and II meningiomas and provides additional information to conventional cross-sectional imaging modalities. Hence, (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET can assist in selecting the time point for treatment initiation. Furthermore, meningiomas with fast tumor growth and transosseous expansion elicit the highest DOTATATE binding; therefore, they might be especially suited for DOTATATE-based therapy.
This study showed a significant influence of the 3-month MRS score on stroke survival. Moreover, independent ambulation may be a major determinant of a favorable survival prognosis. This finding suggests a potential role of rehabilitation in promoting stroke survival by maximizing ambulation function.
There was no significant reduction in bleeding for those who received DDAVP which questions the validity of this practice. Patients with GFR<15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) may possibly derive benefit.
Donor brain death could be a risk factor for the development of vascular rejection in kidney recipients. This process could affect the quality of the graft and host alloresponsiveness. Delayed graft function in transplants from dead brain donors could be a reflection of severe autonomic storm, leading to a higher incidence of vascular rejection in these patients.
Our findings suggest that Sm and myocardial performance index (the Tei index) are significant independent markers to identify patients at high risk for the development of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.
While there were differences between the catheters, only samples taken on Day 1 showed a significant reduction in the numbers of viable bacteria after passing through the catheters. This reduction coincided with higher concentrations of antimicrobial agents in the first few hours after perfusion began. Similarly, bacterial viability declined significantly after storage of Day 1 samples, but only slightly in samples obtained thereafter. The results indicate that drugs released from these antimicrobial catheters are unlikely to affect the diagnosis of ventriculitis, as sampling for this purpose is not usually conducted in the first 24 hours of EVD.
Our results suggest that GITR expression in inflammatory cells might potentially indicate a molecular link between steroid use and complicated forms of acute sigmoid diverticulitis. Increased MMP-9 expression by GITR signalling might explain the morphological changes in the colonic wall of perforated and phlegmonous diverticulitis. Analysis of soluble GITR might be a promising strategy for future research.
The comparison between the CUORE and SCORE mortality risk charts demonstrates that the SCORE charts reflect quite well Italian cardiovascular mortality and, correspondingly, Italian cohorts of the CUORE Project are quite representative of European countries with a low risk of cardiovascular mortality.
In this cross-sectional study among 27 patients with autoimmune adrenalitis, no new cases of adrenocortical recovery were found.
Gout associates with poor overall QOL mainly resulting from associated co-morbidity. Physical health-related QOL, however, remains impaired after adjustment for co-morbidities.
The 11.5-y-old Belarusian children born SGA were shorter, were thinner, and had less body fat than their non-SGA peers, irrespective of postnatal weight gain. The Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial was registered at www.isrctn.org as ISRCTN-37687716.
Despite a relatively low initial success rate (60%), most rectovaginal fistulas can be successfully repaired with subsequent operations. Crohn's disease and smoking are associated with adverse outcomes.
Successful quitters fail to report of an unbearable strong desire to smoke. Such unfounded fear should be communicated. Weight gain remains an undesired side effect. Hence, it is crucial to diagnose individuals more prone to weight gain and offer coping strategies thus reducing the risk of developing obesity. Nevertheless, the outcome of the study should be an encouragement to also heavy smokers and empower them to undertake smoking cessation.
These results demonstrate that reduction of circulating PGE2 concentrations in response to intravenous injection of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 inhibitors does not reduce fetal HPA axis activity. We conclude that PGE2 in late-gestation ovine fetal plasma does not tonically stimulate fetal ACTH secretion.
Despite the limitations of a non-randomized study, photosensitzation with Photosan seems to be more effective in PDT of advanced esophageal carcinoma compared to ALA.
Our data suggest that IBTR risk after BCS in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is increased compared with patients who have sporadic breast cancer. Likewise, the risk of CBC seems to be increased in this group. These risks and the likelihood of developing new primary tumors should be discussed with carriers interested in breast conservation as well as when choosing risk-reducing strategies.
Serum inhibin B can be considered only a partial pharmacodynamic parameter of FSH in vivo, since the integrity of the spermatogenic process appears to be a second fundamental component in the regulation of its secretion from the testis.
Certain aspects of the prison environment (shelter, food, etc.) may be health-promoting for high-risk pregnant women.
Intratympanic injections of methylprednisolone failed to demonstrate efficacy in protecting cisplatin ototoxicity whereas 4% NAC showed a partial protection. The safety of intratympanic injections should be investigated in further studies, as possible systemic shift of the locally administered treatment is suspected.
There were no gender differences in pre-treatment expectations for 21 of 25 possible expectations, small differences for 3 expectations and a strong, clinically important difference for 1 expectation: female patients were more likely than male patients to expect that they would have fewer problems with household activities.
SMVT during the first 72 h of a prime myocardial infarction is an index of a larger healing myocardium with acute very complexed electrophysiological changes and it is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality and a prognostic factor of a poor one year outcome.
Safety-engineered device implementation decreased rates of PIs formally reported and self-reported on the survey. However, this intervention, with concomitant intensive education, had varying effects on reporting behavior by occupation and a minimal effect on overall reporting rates.
These data suggest that a stroke belt does not exist within the Veterans Affairs health care system in terms of either post-admission mortality or inpatient care quality.
The findings reinforced the benefits of DMT while adding the new perspective that delivering DMT intervention throughout cancer treatment can have different and even additional benefits for patients.
Frequent ED users were more likely to make a mental health, alcohol or drug-related visit, but a majority of visits were only noted for those with alcohol-related diagnoses. To address frequent ED use, interventions focusing on managing patients with frequent alcohol-related visits may be necessary.
This study shows that even lumbar degenerative kyphosis patients with spines that are sagittally well compensated by compensatory mechanisms may suffer from intractable back pain and that these patients can be treated effectively by the restoration of lumbar lordosis.
Peritoneal dialysis may be a suitable renal replacement therapy option for PKD patients. PKD is not an additional risk factor in patients treated by PD. Mortality is similar with non-diabetic PD patients. Peritoneal dialysis in PKD patients is associated with a similar overall rate of technique survival, incidences of hernia, leak and infectious complications as in non-PKD patients.
SNB is currently performed in the majority of hospitals in the Veneto region. However, the training phase and criteria used for patient selection differ from centre to centre. Certified training courses and shared guidelines are therefore highly desirable.
The severity of the MM score is not correlated to the severity of OSAS according to AHI results, but it is found to be correlated to EPSS. Vibrating tissues caused local and systemic inflammation in OSAS patients. The correlation between EPSS and MM scores can be explained by this inflammatory process. Further prospective studies have to be done in this field. Müller maneuver in an awake patient might reflect the levels of the obstruction in sleep conditions even though insufficient for figuring out the severity of OSAS.
In cases of small testicular nodule FSE may aid the surgery decision and avoid overtreatment. The close collaboration between urologist and a dedicated pathologist is very useful in reducing diagnostic and therapeutic errors.
Competitive food and beverage legislation can increase food service revenues when accompanied by increased rates of participation in the meal program. Future studies collecting expense data will be needed to determine impact on net revenues.
Teledermatology is not likely to have a great impact on reducing waiting lists. It is possible that it may help to prioritize referrals from remote areas.
Successful monitoring of both fetuses occurred 51.6% of the time. Continuous monitoring efficiency improved with advancing gestational age.
Novices benefited particularly from the robot. The intermediate group completed the task equally well and equally quickly with 3D laparoscopy and the robot. The experts completed the task equally well regardless of instrument, but their times were much faster with 3D laparoscopy. Thus, well-trained laparoscopic surgeons may not really benefit from 3D robot systems if 3D laparoscopy is available.
Pelvic fracture hemorrhage remains a management challenge. In this series, the median time to embolization was more than 5 hours. Nearly 80% of deaths could be attributed to early uncontrolled hemorrhage and linked to delays in hemostasis. Earlier intervention by Acute Care Surgeons with techniques like preperitoneal packing, aortic balloon occlusion, and use of hybrid operative suites may improve outcomes.
There was a decreasing trend over time in the risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates from heart failure, which was not an artifact of decreasing length of stay. Our findings raised the possibility of improved hospital care for heart failure in Oregon.
Informed consent forms for IVF&ET that are currently used in Israel do not adequately serve their stated purpose. Potential risks and benefits are not presented clearly and alternative management strategies are also missing. Thus, they do not fulfill their social, ethical or legal goals. Updating these forms is urgently needed. New versions should clearly distinguish between common (controllable) and uncommon (uncontrollable) complications.
These results suggest that some but not all types of clinician visits are serving an important function in maintaining Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program coverage among low-income patients. Two possible approaches to improve access to care among low-income children therefore would be (1) increased awareness among clinicians, especially in hospitals and emergency departments, regarding Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program retention as an issue in the ongoing care of their patients and (2) Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program reimbursement of clinicians and their staff for assisting patients with the public insurance renewal process.
If ventilation-perfusion lung scans indicate a low or an indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism and bilateral lower extremity compression sonography is performed, only those patients with normal sonographic findings would need further study. Thus, 15% (22/145) of patients could be spared pulmonary arteriography, and the estimated savings in cost would be 9%.
Despite their better efficiency and safety, the latest generation laryngeal masks are still expensive in spite of a low rate of complication. These results do not take into account very rare and severe complications not met in this study in the limited size; then the economic and medical impact can influence the choice beyond the simple analysis cost-efficiency.
Cortico-diaphragmatic pathway is impaired only in a minority of MS patients. Lack of correlation between TMS findings from Dia and respiratory tests argues against its routinary use to detect subclinical respiratory alterations. Fatigue seems to be related to the motor impairment rather than to respiratory distress.
Severe hyperoxaemia and severe hypocapnia were associated with adverse outcome in infants with post-asphyxial HIE. During the first hours of life, oxygen supplementation and ventilation should be rigorously controlled.
Despite the limitations of the study, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy can be considered not only safe and feasible but also permits a better quality of life and is acceptable in terms of cost-effectiveness to Italian and European health care services.
MRU allows detection of crossing vessels in pediatric UPJ obstruction. Although these vessels are the primary cause of obstruction in some children, they are incidental and non-contributory in others. Our study failed to convincingly identify any significant predictors (e.g., age or presence of renal parenchymal edema) that indicate when a crossing vessel is the primary cause of obstruction.
The EB statistics seems to be a good alternative to more conventional statistics used in small-area variation analysis in health service research because of its robustness.
These results suggest that a 10% weight loss in an overweight and obese osteoarthritic population elicits positive changes in the mechanical pathway to knee OA by having lower knee joint compressive loads during walking compared to low and no weight loss groups. The difference in compressive forces was due, in large part, to reductions in hamstring co-contraction during the initial portion of the stance phase.
Although relationships between diseases, impairments, and disability were largely unchanged, disability became less associated with hypertension and more with diabetes and lung disease.
The choice of indexing method by parameters of BSA, height, BW, and BMI does not affect the clinical usefulness of LV mass, LA volume, and LV ESV in predicting HF hospitalization, CV mortality, or all-cause mortality among ambulatory adults with coronary artery disease. Continued use of BSA to index measurements of LV mass, LA volume, and LV ESV is acceptable.
Although an expected strong correlation was observed between hybrid simulator-generated metrics and operating time, this study showed no correlation between simulator-generated metrics and other content-valid outcome measures.
The reversible decrease in eGFR in patients receiving TVR-containing tritherapy can be predicted early, possibly allowing measures aimed at preventing anaemia.
The outcome of this preliminary study contributes to the potential understanding of active components in the therapeutic alliance, and supports further research to achieve a more detailed picture of "non-specific" factors in therapy, including the active process of socialization in therapeutic alliance.
On-site diagnosis of malignancy could be used to initiate informed patient management decisions. Cases where a diagnosis of malignancy is not rendered at on-site interpretation need further cytologic evaluation.
Language impairments are at least as prevalent as executive dysfunction in ALS. While the two domains are strongly associated, executive dysfunction does not fully account for the profile of language impairments observed, further highlighting the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in non-demented patients with ALS.
The vast majority of post-holders in innovative roles felt that the role provided them with a sense of job satisfaction. However, it is essential that the post-holders feel adequately prepared to carry out the role and that the boundaries of their practice are well defined. Career progression and professional integration both being associated with job satisfaction.
Tubeless supracostal percutaneous nephrolithotomy in selected patients is effective with acceptable complications. This technique offers the advantage of lower analgesic requirement, shorter operative time and hospital stay. The pulmonary complication is the same as the standard supracostal percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
The time-varying estimates may have implications for the length and intensity of ACT enrollment. However, the optimum time for receipt of ACT services needs to be considered in the context of outcomes other than hospitalization alone.
DSP hearing aids without low electromagnetic interference processors should not be fitted to clients if personal FM systems are expected to be used. Manufacturers of DSP aids should be encouraged to use low electromagnetic interference processors in their DSP hearing aid design. Meanwhile, FM systems should be used with DSP hearing aids in such a way as to ensure high received radio signal levels, and FM receivers should be switched off when not in use.
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that breast cancers are detected early by organized screening. Cancer characteristics were similar between the two screening modes. Estimating the impact of mammography screening on mortality in Loire-Atlantique should be the object of further investigations.
Based on the experience of this group of patients, repeat ETV is as effective and as safe as a primary ETV procedure, and should be attempted in selected patients.
Pediatric patients currently listed as Status 2 have a survival benefit with transplant out to at least 4 years. A pediatric allocation system restricted to Status 1 patients could only be justified if the vast majority of such patients could be transplanted within 1 to 2 months.
These observations suggest that ATD may reduce cognitive decline in depressed older AD patients.
Ondansetron use in the pediatric ED reduces hospital admissions for suspected gastroenteritis and vomiting. However, children who receive ondansetron in the pediatric ED appear more likely to return to the pediatric ED and be admitted on this return visit than their counterparts. Furthermore, the use of ondansetron does not appear to be associated with increased risks of masking serious diagnoses in children.
General surgical emergency work continues to constitute a major part of the specialists practice. These results emphasize the importance of general surgical training even for those trainees committed to sub-specialisation.
In summary, time spent on physical and sedentary activities were not associated with BMI-for-age, although both of these were associated with the HRQOL of high school students. The potential role of sedentary activities and physical activity should be considered in future interventions aimed at improving HRQOL in adolescents.
In a real-life clinic setting for patients with poorly controlled persistent asthma taking ICS ± LABA, we found no evidence of any relationship of Gly16Arg to IOS, ACQ or salbutamol use.
The only modifiable risk factor identified was fixation method. When considering blood transfusion requirements in isolation, we suggest a potential benefit in using a DHS for intertrochanteric and femoral neck fractures amenable to DHS fixation.
Comparing this cost to current tuitions and fees of LCME-accredited medical schools suggests that revenues other than tuition are needed to cover increases in class size. Tuition and fees revenue from increasing enrollment will not increase overall revenue to medical schools.
Patients who underwent angiographic study in the SHOCK Trial Registry had a more benign cardiac risk profile, more favorable hemodynamic findings and lower in-hospital mortality than those for whom angiograms were not obtained. Patients with CS caused by ventricular failure had more severe atherosclerosis, and a different distribution of culprit vessel involvement but lower in-hospital mortality, than those with mechanical complications. Overall in-hospital survival correlates with the extent of coronary artery obstructions, location of culprit lesion and baseline coronary TIMI flow grade.
These findings may reflect that PTZ-induced epilepsy decreases AG of plasma.
It could be stated that fruit yogurt has no erosive potential.
Even after long-term followup, the amount of bone ingrowth did not surpass host bone levels, suggesting the amount of a patient's host bone is a limiting factor in the amount of bone ingrowth achievable for this cementless design. It remains unknown whether compromised osteopenic bone could achieve the amount of bone attachment necessary to provide durable fixation over time.
With the exception of time lost for recuperation in our community there is little difference in short-term outcome for patients with acute knee injury not undergoing surgery, regardless of the specialty of the treating physician.
Our results suggest a stable L. infantum infection situation among the stray cats of the Madrid area; the disease is uncommon and no clinical cases have been reported to date. The detection of other zoonotic parasites such as T. gondii and T. cati in stray cats indicates a need to adopt strict control measures in this population.
Bridging to transplantation with an LVAD does not increase the risk of transplant CAD. Nevertheless, aggressive prophylactic therapy to minimize potential risk factors for transplant CAD, such as increased cholesterol concentration, is warranted in all transplant recipients.
Two questions using the feeling thermometer provide a quick and accurate assessment of the burden of CD on patients. Physicians' perception of the burden of disease was similar to their patients.
A compromise between predictability and imbalance still has to be found by the investigator but our software (HERMES) gives concrete reasons for choosing between stratification and minimization; it can be downloaded free of charge.
Precolposcopy session with explanation and discussion improves women's knowledge about colposcopy, but has negligible effects on women's anxiety before colposcopy. Provision of written and video information at the precolposcopy sessions can improve compliance to follow-up after colposcopy.
This new diagnostic method of multiplex detection may be helpful to routinely identify carriers of CYP1A2 variants and to improve the therapeutic effectiveness by selection of the most appropriate therapeutic regimen. As a result of this pilot study, there appeared to be no significant correlation between the existence of one of the investigated genetic variants and the development of a mental disorder.
This study shows that even moderately increased ICP can limit the modulation of cerebral blood flow in both vascular territories within the autoregulatory range of cerebral perfusion pressures. The exhaustion of cerebrospinal fluid volume buffering reserve during infusion studies elicits a direct interaction between the cerebrospinal fluid space and the cerebrovascular compartment.
Persons with ideal smiles are considered more intelligent and have a greater chance of finding a job when compared with persons with nonideal smiles.
Children living in the main town or in the refugee camps benefited the most from nutritional relief while those in the rural non-refugee areas were ignored. This is a worrying case of inequity in nutritional relief.
These results suggest that the SDF1 - 3'A and CCR2b-V64I mutations do not affect the course of HCV and HIV/HCV infection in the same manner as does the CCR5-Delta32 mutation.
Endovascular therapy for penetrating aortic ulcers of the descending thoracic aorta is safe and feasible. The number of patients diagnosed with penetrating aortic ulcers is expected to increase as improved imaging systems are becoming more commonplace. As a result, new and safer treatment paradigms will become even more important in the treatment of aortic diseases. Compared with historical surgical results, endovascular therapy for penetrating aortic ulcers of the descending thoracic aorta appears to have less operative mortality and is as equally effective as open surgical repair. Long-term surveillance and continued investigation are warranted.
Computer simulations of bioterrorism defense training scenarios are feasible with existing personal computer technology. The use of internet-connected virtual environments holds promise for bioterrorism defense training. Recommendations are made for public health agencies regarding the implementation and benefits of using virtual reality for mass prophylaxis clinic training.
The prevalence of asthma in the Auvergne region is low in both age groups compared to other regions in France and to Europe. The difference of prevalence between town and countryside may evidence of the influence of environmental factors.
This retrospective study shows that in patients with proposed SAPHO syndrome, the bone lesions are most likely located in ACW, and the configuration of the bullhead sign is characteristic, but not entirely sensitive. The value of upper costosternal junction involvement, especially the first rib, may be underevaluated.
The findings, which were determined using clinic outcomes as markers of the quality of care, highlighted the benefits of increasing senior input within the ENT emergency clinic.
Inadequate antibiotic therapy is associated with longer LOS and higher costs in complicated SSIs. Risk factors for IAT include prior antibiotic therapy, polymicrobial infection, infection with P. aeruginosa or Enterococcus spp., and abdominal incisions.
In its current state, the ICD-9-CM code V09 is not an accurate predictor of MRSA infection and should not be used to measure rates of MRSA infection.
FIT has a higher sensitivity and a lower specificity for CRC in males than in females. Equal test characteristics can be achieved by allowing separate cut-off values for both sexes. Location and age do not explain the observed differences in sensitivity.
Osmotically active HYA and numerous ANP-immunoreactive cells, active in fluid and/or ion transport functions, are present in human nasal polyps. These substances may well be involved in oedema formation and the successive growth of nasal polyps. The high concentrations of HYA in nasal polyps may be of clinical significance for the future development of a local enzyme treatment for nasal polyposis.
The rate of refusal of medical autopsy was low in this survey but information relative to this procedure remains insufficient. The current law imposes to look after a nonopposition to medical autopsy of the died individual, including asking his/her relatives that markedly limit the organ donation. Modification of the French bioethical law should be beneficial to increase both medical autopsy organ donation rates.
SDD is an effective measure to control AGNB-ESBL and to avoid outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection. When tobramycin resistance is found, replacing it with another aminoglycoside based on antibiogram may be more effective in achieving AGNB clearance.
The clinical presentation and outcome of presumed acute appendicitis are similar in pregnant women and nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Therefore, similar perioperative management algorithms may be applied in both patient populations.
Despite the data from literature and standards recommendations, the stitched esophageal perforation has healed after being present longer then 24 hours in 3 from 4 patients. On contrary, in early surgical therapy in 3 patients, 2 had died. The requirement for a time limit in surgical therapy of esophageal perforation is questionable. The lethality round 30 % persists (Tab. 8, Ref. 11). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.
After prolonged tined-lead testing, we found an infection rate comparable to that reported with the usual short test period. In addition, most patients with bacterial growth on tined leads showed no clinical signs of infection. Thus, prolonged tined-lead testing does not seem to induce clinically relevant infection, warranting randomized trials.
The presence of SBO, severe NE and higher frequency of NE in voiding diary affect the response to behavioral interventions. Other treatment options such as medical treatment or enuresis alarm may be recommended for those patients.
Our experience confirmed how often the clinical re-staging data are unreal. Accordingly surgery should be indicated in any case where an induction therapy has been administered, if it is reasonably possible.
We found significant differences between the radiologic findings of patients with H1N1 influenza (severe) and those of patients with symptoms of flu during the flu season: the incidence of multifocal patchy consolidation was greater in H1N1 patients and H1N1 patients were younger.
Linezolid/rifampicin combination therapy was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of anaemia among patients with bone and joint infections, but it did not have an effect on thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy rates. Linezolid/rifampicin combination therapy was not associated with poor clinical outcomes.
FIT positive-iron deficiency anaemia patients without overt bleeding are at increased risk to present with a bleeding lesion at endoscopy, including cancer. FIT positivity in this setting could be useful to prioritize urgent endoscopy.
Soy intake is not associated with AOM in a population of adolescent girls who have a wide range of, and relatively higher, soy intake than the general US population. Our finding suggests that the increasing popularity of soy in the US may not be associated with AOM.
Outcome was not adversely affected by limb salvage, despite the presence of an insensate foot at the time of presentation. More than one-half of the patients who had presented with an insensate foot that was treated with limb reconstruction ultimately regained sensation at two years. Initial plantar sensation is not prognostic of long-term plantar sensory status or functional outcomes and should not be a component of a limb-salvage decision algorithm.
All three studies point to the negative impact of age-related visual impairment on emotional and behavioral adaptation in later life. This highlights the need for a whole range of rehabilitative efforts, including psychosocial elements, which are described in the final part of this article.
Variation of atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed and temperature were not significantly related to the onset of the first episode of PSP in healthy patients. These results suggest that the scientific community should focus on other possible aetiological factors than airway pressure modifications.
The use of the robot improved the quality of the anastomosis for patients that might have raised technical issues.
Changes in CCO across coronary stenoses seem to predict abnormal (TIMI flow grade<3) resting coronary blood flow. Further studies are needed to understand its incremental diagnostic value and its potential to measure stress coronary blood flow.
The bearing geometry and kinematic pattern of different guided-motion prosthetic designs can affect the clinical-functional outcome and complications type in primary TKA.
Preliminary results showed that the BTK clinical test may be used to evaluate potential irritation effects of products that contact mucous membranes. In a first comparison of 2 tampon products in both the in-use and BTK clinical studies, the BTK protocol produced erythema reactions at the test sites that were similar to or severer than those observed on mucosal sites in the in-use study. Overall, the BTK clinical test showed a higher sensitivity, rapid turnaround time, higher flexibility and easier implementation. Thus, making the BTK clinical test a more useful tool for both safety testing and claim support.
Pre-participation disparities in terms of parents' educational level, through interaction with gender, BMI, and self-reported general health are associated with increased injury risk in community-based youth football. When introduced as a general health promotion, football associations should adjust community-based youth programs to accommodate children and adolescents with increased pre-participation injury risk.
Cardiac toxicity of amitriptyline overdose, as manifested by QRS widening, is reversible by pH changes alone.
The children in the group studied were unlikely to have been molested by identifiably gay or lesbian people.
Prehospital MEWS is useful in identifying non-trauma patients requiring LSI within 4 h of ED presentation. This may in turn enhance the triage accuracy in the ED in addition to clinical assessment.
Wider fluctuation in mood in pregnant and postnatal women is consistent with the common belief that perinatal women are moodier than non-perinatal women.
Few individuals will develop rectosigmoid neoplasms 3 or 5 yr after a normal FS. The majority of neoplasms detected are low-risk lesions. A screening interval of 5 yr after a normal FS does not portend an increased risk of advanced neoplasms including cancer. This direct evidence supports the current recommendations of a 5-yr interval for colorectal cancer screening with FS.
Biopsy Gleason score remained strongly associated with progression even when the pathological Gleason score was known and controlled for. If confirmed at other centers, incorporation of biopsy Gleason score into postoperative nomograms designed to estimate the progression risk might improve model precision.
Throughout PNG there is an urgent need to increase immunization coverage and to ensure that children are immunized on time according to the schedule. Both coverage and timeliness of doses are worse for children living in hard-to-reach and rural areas. Achieving national immunization targets requires improvements in health service delivery, including outreach, especially for remote and rural communities, as well as greater community education and social mobilisation in support of immunization services.
No significant loss of efficacy occurs when sildenafil is taken shortly before or with a meal. The duration of action for sildenafil may exceed 10 hours.
One in 5 patients with an ABCD(2) score<4 had high-risk disease requiring urgent treatment decision-making. When triaging on an ABCD(2) score, we recommend adding systematic carotid ultrasound (or a default angiographic CT scan) and electrocardiography within 24 hours before postponing complete transient ischemic attack evaluation.
The treatment of inguinal hernia by the suture technique is followed by significant anatomical changes such as reduction of the surface area and a subsequent increase of tension in the inguinal region. This could be one of the main reasons for chronic pain and hernia recurrence.
Sexual function and satisfaction seem to be correlated with mental and physical health in female and male kidney-transplant recipients, respectively. Although in the two genders, both physical and mental health should be equally evaluated; improving of the sexual function may be better achieved through different approaches.
By conducting glaucoma screening during regular optician visits, a large section of the population at risk of developing glaucoma can be reached.
Our results suggest that the presence of carotid artery calcifications on panoramic radiographs may be related to the history of past vascular diseases; however, this is not a useful marker for subsequent vascular diseases and related death among 80-year-olds.
1. The ovine incisor model presents opportunities to investigate irrigation regimes under controlled ex-vivo conditions. 2.NaOCl (5%) remains the most effective irrigant for rapid debris removal in immature root canals. 3. Carisolv cleans pulp debris from the walls of immature root canals as effectively as NaOCl (1%) during static, unrefreshed wall contact for between 20 and 30 min. 4. Refreshment of NaOCl (1%) enhances its cleaning ability above that of Carisolv.
Of all the patients admitted with poisoning, the treatment of nearly all the patients in good medical condition and most of the patients whose general condition was not good was completed within the Emergency Department before they were discharged from the hospital. Even when the general condition of the patients was not good at the time of presentation, it was regulated by the physicians through definitive interventions.
In the present study, findings indicate that the association between birth weight and breast cancer risk, seen only in women diagnosed early (<or=50 years), is not confounded by familial factors.
A family of KChIP2 proteins is expressed in human hearts that exhibits differential modulation of hKv4.3 current in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. The effect of KChIP2 on the biophysical properties of expressed Kv4.3 current and the absence of a gradient of protein across the ventricular wall suggest that KChIP2 is either not a requisite component of human or canine ventricular I(to) or that its functional effect is being affected or additionally modified by other factors present in myocardial cells.
Half of patients with biliary pancreatitis experience "warning" episodes of biliary colic, similar to other gallstone complications. In symptomatic patients, complications are often not prevented because of significant delays in diagnosis and treatment.
Plasma levels of big endothelin, PIIINP, and MMP-2 were found to be associated with the presence of early diagnosed HFNEF. However, none of these biomarkers contributed independently to current noninvasive HFNEF diagnostics recommended by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines.
Results from the present study as well as those provided in the international literature suggest that current French occupational exposure limits for TCE are too high regarding a possible risk of RCC.
In the field of bypass surgery, the angiosome concept seems unimportant, at least in non-ESRD cases. The location and extent of ischaemic wounds as well as co-morbidities may be more relevant than the angiosome in terms of wound healing.
The discrepancies in the outcome among endocrine lymphomas could be partly attributed to their biologic variability, which might be determined by the initial site involved. We conclude that treatment decisions should be made according to a multi-disciplinary approach to avoid unnecessary surgery. Existing treatment strategies for PTL and PAL fail to provide long-term survival, rendering the application of novel therapeutic approaches essential.
Using interstitial PDR-brachytherapy in head-and-neck-tumors the probability of local control and of the development of soft tissue necrosis or osteoradionecrosis is dependent on dose and volume parameter like the volume of the reference isodose, the high and peak dose values, on the homogeneity of the dose distribution, quantified by the quality index or the volume gradient ratio as well on the minimal tube distance.
Barium trapping in rectoceles changes with the degree of rectal evacuation. More complete evacuation was shown on the posttoilet radiograph than on the postevacuation radiograph. Consequently, the posttoilet radiograph may be more appropriate for the preoperative assessment of barium trapping within rectoceles.
Although the immune response to the identical A/H1N1 vaccine antigen was similar in both groups, priming with different A/H3N2 antigens and B antigens in the spring produced a lower immune response to both antigens than that shown in children who received 2 doses of the same vaccine in the fall. However, approximately 70% of children in the spring group had a protective response to the H3N2 antigen after 2 doses. Initiating influenza immunization in the spring was superior to 1 dose of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in the fall. The goal of delivering 2 doses of influenza vaccine a month apart to vaccine-naive children within the narrow flu vaccination season is a challenge not yet met; thus far, only about half of children aged 6 to 23 months of age are receiving influenza vaccine. By using the spring schedule, we were able to administer 2 doses of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine to a higher proportion of children earlier in the influenza vaccination season. In years when there is an ample supply of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, and vaccine remains at the end of the season, priming influenza vaccine-naive infants with a spring dose will lead to the earlier protection of a higher proportion of infants in the fall. This strategy may be particularly advantageous when there is an early start to an influenza season as occurred in the fall of 2003. A priming dose of influenza vaccine in the spring may also offer other advantages. Many vaccine-naive children may miss the second dose of fall trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine because of vaccine shortages or for other reasons, such as the potential implementation of new antigens at a late date. Even with seasonal changes in influenza vaccine antigens, by giving a springtime dose of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, such children would be more protected against influenza than would children who were only able to receive 1 dose in the fall. In summary, our data suggest that identical influenza antigens are not necessary for priming vaccine-naive children and that innovative uses of influenza vaccine, such as a springtime dose of vaccine, could assist in earlier and more complete immunization of young children.
These results suggest that the DAT might provide additional prognostic information regarding patients with IgHV unmutated status.
In patients undergoing RC with UD there was no significant difference in UIA stricture rates between those with and without previous pRT.
Incidents involving military-style weapons pose a unique challenge for prehospital care providers who must care for injured civilians and law enforcement personnel while maintaining their own safety. Use of the Incident Command System, establishment of a liaison with law enforcement, and the provision of protective gear for EMS personnel are vital to effectively and safely manage these types of incidents.
While the increase in CDR with the use of CAD only approached statistical significance, representing modest gains in absolute terms, the incremental number of cancers detected justifies the incremental recall and benign surgical biopsy attributable to CAD use. In our clinical setting, these data suggest more benefit than harm in using CAD with DM, and we will continue the use of CAD with ongoing monitoring of patient outcomes.
Pain response to a fixed 1 mg intravenous dose of hydromorphone did not vary by total body weight in this sample of adults aged 18 to 65 years, suggesting no advantage to weight-based over fixed opioid dosing.
Although PEF is an important tool in the management of asthmatic patients, it does not yield a complete picture because it is not sensitive in detecting small airways function. It is best used at home along with regular spirometry measurements at the clinic. PEF may serve as a better index of changes in small airways function once an individual regression is determined.
Sternocleidomastoid release was beneficial for the treatment of neglected congenital muscular torticollis in adults and was not associated with any serious complications. Surgical treatment led to cosmetic and functional improvements and relieved pain originating from the muscle imbalance brought about by the long-standing deformity.
This study provides Level 1 evidence that locally administered depomedrol on a collagen sponge significantly decreases postoperative dysphagia incidence and magnitude following anterior cervical spine fusion using low-dose rhBMP-2.
Despite earlier optimistic findings, there is little evidence to suggest that survey administration per se will be effective in increasing blood supplies. Implications for behavior change mechanisms are discussed.
It is postulated that the reduction in the number of LCs may be one of the reasons for a higher tendency of carcinogenesis in the vulvar region. Their role as a main element of the skin immune system in the initiation of this process needs further investigation. It is possible that research on LCs in the skin will cast a new light on their role and even contribute to the prophylaxis and treatment of skin and mucosa carcinomas.
Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the 10% hydrogel form of sodium ascorbate may be used in clinical procedures instead of its solution form. However, using sodium ascorbate hydrogel with concentrations lower than 10% may not be as reliable as using this agent in 10% concentration for reversing the compromised bond strength.
Against widely held opinion, our exploratory analysis showed that women with gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia at term who have an unfavourable cervix benefited more from labour induction than other women.
No difference was found in proprioception between recreational athletes with patellar tendinopathy and healthy recreational athletes. It is unclear whether such a small difference in TTDPM between affected and unaffected knee is important in clinical setting.
Small adults are still less likely to be transplanted at six months in adult only units in the UK. The lack of size matched organs for smaller adults and the overall decrease in rates of transplantation in the UK may be remedied by careful consideration of allocation policy and increased use of innovative techniques.
More primary care clinicians in KPNC reported clinical integration than did general practitioners in the DHS. Focused measures of clinical integration are needed to develop the field of clinical integration and to create the scientific foundation to guide managers searching for evidence based approaches.
Preoperative hydronephrosis on axial imaging is associated with features of aggressive disease and predicts advanced pathologic stage for UTUC. Hydronephrosis can be a valuable prognostic tool for preoperative planning and counseling regarding disease outcomes.
Adjusting for area- and individual-level socio-economic conditions explained the excess risk associated with residents of GGC for most (16 out of 18) outcomes; however, significant excess risks for two outcomes remained: anxiety and heart attack. Additional explanations are, therefore, required.
These data show the excellent tolerability (maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been determined yet) and the potential therapeutic role of RIT in advanced ovarian cancer. Patients with minimal residual disease would probably take the best advantages of RIT with (90)Y-biotin (electrons). These data warrant further prospective studies.
It is possible to predetermine hamstring tendons length through linear regression formulas before surgical intervention.
Medical students have been responsible for organizing the majority of new PDT. To ensure quality and sustainability, however, faculty must play a more central role in the planning and implementation of such training programs. Medical schools must continue to reevaluate how best to maximize global health electives for trainees and the communities in which they study. PDT offers one avenue for schools to ensure that students are safe and socially accountable during their time abroad.
Patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were exposed to large RBC transfusion volumes for treatment of mild anemia resulting from blood loss, particularly phlebotomy. In the majority of events, RBC transfusion did not significantly alter global tissue oxygenation, as assessed by changes in SvO2 and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy. Most transfusions were administered at a time at which the patient did not appear to be oxygen delivery dependent according to global measures of tissue oxygenation.
Behcet's disease can be a risk for osteoporosis especially in the lumbar spine. We determined a negative correlation between IL-1 and femur neck BMD (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 23).
In comparison to the control group, incorporation of propolis to conventional restorative glass ionomer cement decreased the compressive strength significantly. The solubility of the cement in the experimental group increased significantly over 7day period as compared to the control group.
This study suggests that there should be careful consideration of the role of hospital factors in perinatal deregionalization in order to preserve the improvements in maternal and infant outcomes associated with regionalized perinatal care.
Our results are consistent with established data regarding DVT and PE incidence. Administrative data available in Japan provides a powerful epidemiologic tool to characterize rare diseases such as DVT and PE. DVT is not a suitable quality indicator in Japan. However, PE is too rare to be considered a rate-based outcome indicator, and VTE prophylaxis is [corrected] widely applied to be used as a process indicator. VTE measurement is not a useful quality indicator in Japan to compare hospitals but provides a longitudinal self-survey.
a repetitive ADL exercise programme may improve health status in the short term in a group of frail older people living in residential care. Further research is needed to establish sustainability of change.
C-spine precautions can be withdrawn without additional imaging in most blunt trauma patients with C-spine tenderness but negative neurologic evaluation and C-spine CT. Focus should be placed on the detailed and comprehensive interpretation of the C-spine CT.
Emergency rooms are better equipped to meet the needs of critically ill paediatric patients coming from outside the hospital than the paediatric departments. Paediatricians involved in the treatment of children who become critically ill during their stay in the hospital (the "indoor" patients), have less equipment and medication on the paediatric department at their disposal than on their emergency room. Obviously, emergency care on the paediatric wards should be equipped at the same level as in the emergency room because for both locations the "golden hour" is critically important in final outcome.
In our series, there was no difference in measurable outcomes between early and delayed resection of congenital lung lesions. These data provide some support for a management strategy that might include observation with delayed resection for asymptomatic patients.
Acute temporary postoperative urinary retention is rare after midurethral slings. Glycopyrrolate during anesthesia induction does not appear significantly to increase this rate.
If current guidelines are applied, all cases of malignancy may be picked up, but identification of patients with curable disease is poor. Use of the guidelines did not select patients with other upper gastrointestinal disease, although many patients were receiving acid-suppression therapy at the time of their endoscopy. Implementation of test-and-treat strategies would result in a significant reduction in the workload of open-access endoscopy.
Craniofacial surgeons with various experience levels were able to accurately diagnose single-sutural synostosis by physical examination alone. Considering potential side effects from ionizing radiation, risks of sedation, and costs, surgeons may wish to reserve computed tomographic scans only for infants with suspected single-sutural craniosynostosis in whom the physical examination is not clearly diagnostic.
Patients transferred to tertiary care centers for emergency upper extremity evaluation have a higher rate of undesirable or no insurance and are more likely to be male or unemployed.
Increasing operative time was associated with increased odds of complications and, therefore, it appears that speed may matter in laparoscopic surgery. These analyses are limited in their inability to adjust for all patient factors, potential confounders, and case complexities. Additional hierarchical multivariate analyses at the surgeon level would be important to examine this relationship further.
Nurse's knowledge and comfort related to diabetes survival skill teaching were low. The strongest correlate of higher DKSST score was length of time as a nurse. Because previous education and other nurse characteristics were not associated with higher test scores, nurse educators and advanced practice nurses must modify education delivery modalities to improve retention of information used in the delivery of patient education about diabetes survival skills.
Even in patients with few coronary collaterals, the myocardial adaptation to repetitive ischemia is closely related to collateral recruitment. Pharmacologic preconditioning using a treatment with i.c. adenosine before angioplasty does not occur. The variable responses of ECG signs of ischemic adaptation to collateral channel opening suggest that ischemic preconditioning is a relevant factor in the development of ischemic tolerance.
The results of this study clearly show that routine peritoneal drain placement after laparotomy for TIP is unnecessary, and such drains are not effective in reducing the rate of postoperative complications.
New medical students' attitudes toward patient-centered care may shape their response to curricula and the quality and style of care that they provide as physicians. Some students may be predisposed to attitudes that lead to both greater receptivity to curricula and the provision of higher-quality, more patient-centered care.
The goal of the residency selection process is to evaluate the candidate's potential for success in residency and beyond. The results of this study suggest that a simple-to-administer clinical skills test may have predictive value for success in residency and clinician quality.
The placement of intra-abdominal drain in complicated acute appendicitis may not present benefits and may even lengthen hospital stay. These observations suggest that there is no need of using a drain in laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated acute appendicitis.
The rate of cervical shortening after cerclage placement is associated with the risk of SPTB. Sonographic surveillance of the rate of cervical shortening may be useful in assessing risk for SPTB in patients with cerclage.
Patients admitted to hospital from care homes are commonly dehydrated on admission and, as a result, appear to experience significantly greater risks of in-hospital mortality.
The study shows that low lactose milk powder is a well-accepted nutritional supplement without reducing habitual dietary intake.
Patellar tape may reduce malalignment and pain associated with patellofemoral joint OA.
Will anaesthesiologists accept their present high workload for the next 20 years? If not, the consequences will be serious. Three-quarters (75.4%) of the replies identified a need for more anaesthesiologists and considered that an anaesthesiologist supervising anaesthesia nurses for a number of patients simultaneously was a possible solution.
Lowering the LDL-C level with intensive lipid-lowering therapy is associated with reduced changes in the IMT among Japanese subjects at moderate to high risk under treatment for primary prevention. Subjects suitable for primary prevention may receive cardiovascular benefits from intensive lipid-lowering therapy, in association with significantly slower IMT progression than that observed with conventional therapy.
There is a close relationship between erythrocyte deformations with onset of preeclampsia-eclampsia syndrome prior to presentation of the triad high blood pressure-edema-proteinuria.
These results do not clearly indicate that diltiazem is effective in calcinosis associated with SSc. Among the patients with SSc, those who also had SCC exhibited a distinctive autoimmune profile and more severe cutaneous capillary injury than those without SCC.
There is no strong evidence that completion of informed consent itself alters self-reporting behaviour with regards to alcohol, though the effect of settings needs to be further studied.
GP accounts indicated concern about threats to patient care. Contention between using severity questionnaires and delivering individualised patient care is significantly motivated by GP concerns to preserve professional expertise and identity. It is important to learn from GP concerns to help establish how best to optimise the use of severity questionnaires in depression.
Because the findings published in 2005 by El-Zein and co-workers could not be replicated, the concern regarding a potential increase in the risk of developing cancer later in life after long-term MPH treatment is not supported.
Apart from age-related onset of seizure types and syndromes with a loose upper limit of onset age, patients with a late onset did not differ from their younger counterparts. These data do not support the view of IGE of late onset as a separate syndrome.
There is a relation between depressed abdominal scars and intra-abdominal adhesions, whereas pigmentation status does not differ between women with or without adhesions.
Programmatic conversion from brand to generic tacrolimus resulted in increased drug variability, a greater incidence of magnesium wasting, and more episodes of rejection, leading to increases in institutional costs of care. This government-driven attempt at cost containment may be applicable to noncritical medications such as antibiotics and antihypertensives, but this policy should be reconsidered for narrow therapeutic index medications, such as tacrolimus and other immunosuppressant medications.
Advanced imaging was most often performed for appropriate indications, but biomarkers were used for nonrecommended surveillance. Distinguishing between inappropriate use for surveillance and appropriate diagnostic testing is essential when evaluating adherence to recommendations.
Surgical excision of lung metastases from soft tissue sarcomas is well accepted and should be considered as a first line of treatment if preoperative evaluation indicated that complete resection of the metastases is possible. Further investigation is needed before chemotherapy can be recommended as additional therapy.
In the absence of sufficient evidence-based data to support the existence of differences in the tolerance profile of low-dose combined OCPs, future well-designed randomized trials are needed to guide providers in their choice of OCPs. However, research should also assess the effectiveness of counseling on the tolerance of OCPs, an intervention that may prove to be more rewarding than basing the choice of OCPs on their theoretical properties.
Hospital differences in the frequency of adverse obstetric outcomes could not be explained by differences in frequency of types of care provided.
Underimmunization at 3 and 7 months of age was associated with confirmed maltreatment, specifically physical abuse, in children evaluated for child maltreatment. The association between underimmunization and child abuse in the general population deserves further study.
Although in general earlier cochlear implantation led to better outcomes, there were few differences in outcome between the small sample of six children implanted before 12 mos of age and those implanted at 13 to 24 mos. Significant performance differences remained among the other age groups despite accounting for potential confounds. Further, oral language development progressed faster in children implanted earlier rather than later in of life (up to age 4 yrs), whereas the rate of open-set speech recognition development was similar. Together, the results suggest that there is a sensitive period for spoken language during the first 4 yrs of life, but not necessarily for word recognition development during the same period.
The patient made good progress and was well on discharge from the ICU 26 h postenvenomation.
Based on the above results, we believe that for patients with Stage III Pancreatic Duct Carcinoma, pancreatic resection should not be the initial treatment option. These patients should be treated first with Locoregional Combined Immunochemotherapy. Then depending upon their response, should be assigned to a subsequent pancreatic resection.
Results of whole body protein metabolism measured with the [15N]glycine single oral dose method in children with MSS and in healthy children were in line with expectations based on results obtained in earlier reports and with different methods.
These results underline that mpEs are distinctly different from Es and aEs at the genetic level and that extensive genomic alterations and aneuploidy in ependymal tumors are not in itself an indicator of malignant behavior.
In a large-scale evaluation of GP records of people living with HIV, gaps in ART recording and co-prescribing were identified, and evidence demonstrated missed opportunities for diagnosis within general practice. Specialists and generalists must communicate better to enhance safe prescribing and reduce delayed diagnosis.
The presence of excreted contrast in the gallbladder lumen can be determined using gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI without precontrast T1-weighted imaging.
Although the study was preliminary in nature no clear benefit could be found in filling deciduous molar teeth against leaving carious teeth unfilled, if avoidance of extraction was the desired outcome. The treatment philosophy of dentists was a major factor in determining extraction or exfoliation outcomes. This issue is complex with many interacting factors to be accounted for and will require multiple well-designed studies to provide an answer.
Training of EM residents in bioterrorism preparedness has increased markedly since 1998. However, training is often of low intensity, relying mainly on nonexperiential instruction such as lectures. Although current recommendations are that training in bioterrorism include experiential learning experiences, the authors found the rate of these experiences to be low.
Residual disease is found in nearly half of repeat operations after conization with positive margins for HSIL or microinvasive cervical cancer. Particularly, residual disease is present in 80% of the patients with more than 2 involved quadrants. This should be considered when making management decisions.
The synthesis of IFN-gamma is significantly reduced after cardiac surgery. The application of IL-12 causes an increase in IFN-gamma synthesis before surgery and a return of IFN-gamma to preoperative levels within a few days after surgery. These findings suggest that postoperative suppression of IFN-gamma release is caused by a decrease in IL-12 synthesis. In addition, IL-12 has a mainly proinflammatory effect both before and after surgery.
Absorbable stabilisers may be used for minimal invasive surgery for pectus excavatum but they are more vulnerable and break easier than metal stabilisers. This is likely a consequence of high stress forces that may be more pronounced in patients who receive a shorter pectus bar, but further research is needed.
Our studies show that, in the presence of erroneous links, the connectivity distribution of scale-free networks is still scale-free for the middle range connectivities, but can be greatly distorted for low and high connecitivities. It is more appropriate to use robust estimators such as the least trimmed mean squares estimator to estimate the scale parameter gamma under such circumstances. Moreover, we show by simulation studies that the scale-free property is robust to some error mechanisms but untenable to others. The simulation results also suggest that different error mechanisms may be operating in the yeast protein interaction networks produced from different data sources. In the MIPS gold standard protein interaction data, there appears to be a high rate of false negative links, and the false negative and false positive rates are more or less constant across proteins with different connectivities. However, the error mechanism of yeast two-hybrid data may be very different, where the overall false negative rate is low and the false negative rates tend to be higher for links involving proteins with more interacting partners.
Adjuvant radiotherapy for muscle invasive bilharzial related squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder has potential effectiveness and minor side effects. Moreover, Bcl-XL expression is a valuable tool for predicting those who might not respond to this adjuvant treatment.
The bronchial tree is significantly better visualized when using non-ECG-gated MDCT compared to ECG-gated MDCT. Additionally, non-ECG-gated techniques require less radiation exposure. Thus, the current retrospective ECG-gating technique does not provide any additional benefit for 3D visualization of the bronchial tree and VB.
Multimodality treatment including hepatic resection should be encouraged for advanced HCC patients with PV thrombi, BD involvement or compression or invasion of the IVC, as long as the remnant liver can overcome postoperative liver failure.
This study supports the recommendation of using spot urine P/Cr ratio in proteinuria screening in patients with different kidney diseases. The obtained results indicated better agreement between morning P/Cr and 24-hour PRT in patients with lower proteinuria and better kidney function.
Functional monitoring is a poorly effective method in early estimation of anthracycline induced cardiac dysfunction. Estimation of biomarkers after chemotherapy may allow stratification of patients in various risk groups, thereby opening window for interventional strategies in order to prevent permanent damage to the myocardium.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that when compared with control conditions, psychological treatment might be more efficacious for high-severity than for low-severity patients. Because the number of studies reporting within-study severity analyses is small, we recommend that future studies routinely report tests for Severity × Treatment interactions.
Liver biopsy remains the gold standard to assess the extent of hepatic fibrosis in patients with CHC.
The majority of the uterine cornua had a tubal remnant which suggests that RRSO may leave behind residual tubal epithelium. The clinical significance of this tubal remnant is unclear given the current understanding of tubal carcinogenesis.
Cytology of peritoneal lavage with conventional staining should no longer be performed during laparoscopic staging of GI malignancies because it provides an additional benefit in only 1.3% of patients and has limited prognostic value for survival in this group of patients.
Positive responses to self report survey questions about anxiety/nervousness are associated with adverse health outcomes, particularly hospital admission for deliberate self harm. This is an alarming signal bearing in mind the rapid increase in prevalence of perceived anxiety in the Swedish society.
In our general medicine practice, obesity does not appear to be associated with less Pap smear performance. Physicians are more likely to report delaying obese patients' Pap smears due to acute illness, vaginitis, or menstruation.
IFN alfa-2a can be a treatment option for patients with otherwise treatment resistant uveitic CME.
The calculation of buffer reactions in a hypothetical acidic urine predicted a negligible effect on urine pH on loss of CO(2) by air exposure, which was empirically proven by the experimental study. Therefore, exposure of urine to air does not substantially alter the results of diagnostic tests for urine acidification, and urine collection under oil is not necessary.
BMG and PSG have comparable success rates in treatment of long anterior urethral strictures. Operative time is significantly longer in BMG. Long-segment strictures are associated with longer operative time, more blood loss, and more occurrence of postvoid dribbling. However, the length of the stricture has no influence on the success rate and functional outcomes of DOU.
Survival in pediatric HCC is more likely when complete tumor resection can be achieved. Intensification of platinum agents in the S2 and S3 trials has not resulted in improved survival. New treatment approaches in pediatric HCC should be postulated.
The seventh AJCC/UICC staging system is not more clinically useful than the sixth system in surgically treated patients with gastric cancer because of an inappropriate N classification. A new TNM system is required with a different N classification.
Patients treated with a rapid steroid taper protocol followed by Neoral monotherapy or a slow taper protocol showed similar acute rejection incidences and severities. Their survival rates were also comparable. Further study is necessary to evaluate the impact of rapid steroid taper to prevent the complications of steroid use.
Small or medium VSDs can be treated definitively with a ventricular septal occluder or initially to stabilize patients and allow myocardial fibrosis, thus facilitating delayed subsequent surgical correction.
Bone imaging with 99mTc methylene diphosphonate is not a specific method of making the diagnosis of costochondritis.
Our results are consistent with an antagonism between nitrous oxide and isoflurane; however, the degree of antagonism is small.
Primary AOT shows better functional outcomes compared with secondary AOT after failed microfracture in patients with similar characteristics and lesion size. No significant differences in T2 mapping relaxation times and MOCART scores were identified.
We describe the phenotypic expression, postulated mechanisms and prognosis of strip-like infarcts between the superior and inferior MCA divisions. The likely artery-artery or cardio-embolic mechanisms should prompt clinicians to search for an embolic source. While the prognosis of the syndrome is generally good, its recognition may allow specific therapies to be developed to improve clinical outcomes further.
Individual variations of corneal birefringence, which are not completely corrected by FCC, result in over- or underestimation of retinal nerve fiber layer parameters. This measurement error cannot be eliminated, not even by only selecting patients with a uniform aspect of macular scan. For this reason GDx FCC does not seem to be an acceptable tool in the early diagnosis of glaucoma, and modern versions of this device should be preferred.
Male patients might benefit from APL bands, in contrast to female patients who appear to experience superior weight loss with the smaller APS bands. This study provides the first set of evidence to facilitate surgical decision making for band size selection and highlights differences between genders.
The data support BASDAI as being a valid and appropriate composite to define disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis. Developed as a simple sum of its components, BASDAI has excellent content validity.
PON1 seems to be associated to cardiovascular risk markers in T1D. This result remains to be seen. Nevertheless, improving PON1 activity could be a significant target for reducing cardiovascular risk.
Decades after pregnancy, women who had an HPD have higher uric acid concentrations. This effect does not appear to be explained by a familial predisposition to elevated uric acid concentrations.
Significant deficiencies exist regarding self-reported knowledge of core PAG topics among Ob/Gyn residents at programs without PAG-trained faculty. Use of the NASPAG Short Curriculum by residents without access to PAG-trained faculty resulted in improved self-reported knowledge in PAG.
A nurse call system that allows nurses to discern the reason behind a nurse call allows them to make a more accurate decision and relieves stress. In particular, the information communicated would reduce uncertainty and lessen nurses' dependence on other factors in their decision. The design of such a system should, however, carefully consider the needs of the department in which it is deployed.
Agent-based modelling has great potential as a tool for exploring the reciprocal relationships between environments and individuals, and for highlighting how intended changes in one domain of a system may produce unintended consequences in other domains. The exploration of these linkages is important in an environment as complex as the drug policy and intervention arena.
Over one-third of medical students had a significant implicit anti-fat bias; few were aware of that bias. Accordingly, medical schools' obesity curricula should address weight-related biases and their potential impact on care.
This study indicates the rather lower IgG-PT level sustained 1 year after the acellular pertussis vaccine booster dose, and substantial proportion of population susceptibility to pertussis in Zhejiang Province, China. Moreover, pertussis infection is not uncommon; it was estimated that 10% of subjects were recently infected approximately within the last 100 days. We highly suggest that the surveillance capacity should be strengthened and consider introducing booster dose that protect against pertussis in 6 years old children.
During CPB, serum S100beta protein level increases and this increase is higher in the nonpulsatile group. High serum level of S100beta protein is associated with increased levels of serum inflammatory mediators and systemic inflammatory response.
The appearance of dermatofibromas is markedly influenced by architectural, e.g. in deep penetrating dermatofibroma, and/or cellular/stromal criteria, e.g. in epithelioid cell histiocytoma or sclerosing dermatofibroma. Cellular neurothekeoma seems to be a variant of dermatofibromas with both architectural and cellular/stromal peculiarities, i.e. plexiform pattern, epithelioid cytology and stromal sclerosis.
Three components of metabolic syndrome (elevated BP, high BMI, elevated insulin levels) correlate strongly in young adolescents born SGA; BRS is reduced in prehypertensive patients. Close follow-up is warranted during adult life as they are predisposed for developing a metabolic syndrome with elevated cardiovascular risk.
Prior reports of anabolic steroid-induced hepatotoxicity based on elevated aminotransferase levels may have been overstated, because no exercising subjects, including steroid users, demonstrated hepatic dysfunction based on GGT levels. Such reports may have misled the medical community to emphasize steroid-induced hepatotoxicity when interpreting elevated aminotransferase levels and disregard muscle damage. For these reasons, when evaluating hepatic function in cases of anabolic steroid therapy or abuse, CK and GGT levels should be considered in addition to ALT and AST levels as essential elements of the assessment.
Younger patients with solitary metachronous metastases to the liver, then the lung, and long disease-free intervals are more likely to benefit from resection of both liver and lung metastases. Patients with risk factors also had better survival with resection than without resection.
Significantly greater technical difficulty was experienced with our 'morbidly obese' manikin compared with the unmodified manikin. Failure rates and times to completion were considerably more consistent with real-life reports. Modifying a standard manikin to simulate an obese patient is likely to better prepare anaesthetists for this challenging situation. Development of a commercial manikin with such properties would be of value.
Our study investigated phenotypic differences of familial glioma compared to sporadic control. Our finding of a distinct pattern of increased p53- and Pgp-negativity among cases warrants further investigation.
The absence of bladder or rectal invasion can be diagnosed with sufficient confidence using an MRI scoring system to safely obviate the need for invasive cystoscopic or endoscopic staging in the majority of patients with cervical cancer. This could potentially lead to a reduction in staging costs and morbidity.
No effect of PFMT was found when the exercises were taught in a general fitness class for pregnant women without individual instruction of correct PFM contraction. Low adherence and the small sample size may have contributed to the negative results. Further studies are warranted to assess the effect of population-based PFMT in the prevention of urinary and fecal incontinence.
Patients older than 75 years of age were less likely to receive endovascular treatments. Older patients had higher rates of SICH, disability, and mortality. Prospective randomized trials are needed to determine the criteria for selecting patients most likely to benefit from acute endovascular therapies.
The substantial contribution of the perception of neighbourhood built environmental attributes to AT found in Belgian adults, could not totally be confirmed by this study for Belgian adolescents. Among Belgian adolescents, the contribution of neighborhood environmental perceptions to explain the variance in AT seems to be dependent of the purpose of AT. Further research is needed to explore this relationship in specific subgroups and to overcome some of the limitations this study had to contend with.
The study indicates that a lack of job resources--particularly influence at work--are more important predictors of LTSA than high job demands.
Device-free HALDN can be performed with no discernable compromise in operating time or patient outcome. This has implications in both cost benefit and translation of this technique to developing units.
The authors' findings indicate that subjective tinnitus appears to be characterized by autoimmune and inflammatory events. Considering the decreasing MPV levels, MPV may be used to evaluate subjective tinnitus as an helper indicator.
Although increased sampling of the prostate does not increase the detection of potentially insignificant tumors, it does appear to detect earlier stage cancer.
Increasing prices via taxation is an effective way of reducing the consumption of RYO tobacco but due to associations between RYO tobacco smoking and lower incomes, these policies should be accompanied by measures aimed at helping smokers to quit.
Based on this first study, in which MPO-mediated AOPP formation has been demonstrated, it may be suggested that activated neutrophils may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD and that chlorinated oxidants of neutrophil origin may lead to oxidative stress, notably protein oxidation. Therefore, AOPP may be a useful marker for monitoring the progress and the severity of the disease activity.
The patients with acute MI received management compliant with evidence-based practice. However, more awareness to the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as well as hypolipidemic agents is needed to provide maximum benefit to these patients. Moreover, national guidelines for the management of acute MI are needed for improvement of quality of care.
Telephone-based intervention delivered by a health educator was moderately efficacious in reducing at-risk drinking at 3 months after enrollment among older adults receiving a multi-faceted intervention in primary care settings; however, the effect was not sustained at 12 months.
Retrieval of GTFs 90 days after implantation in an ovine model was feasible, safe, and easy, and required little force (median, 4.2 N).
CD4+CD25-Foxp3+ T cells in UNOL patients are different from regulatory T cells, both phenotypically and functionally. CD127 is not an appropriate surface marker for intracellular Foxp3 in CD4+CD25- T cells.
Physician fee programs seem to provide the most direct and robust incentives to enhance hospital efficiency under a fee-for-service regime like that in Taiwan. Because of time-lagged effects, hospitals that implemented the total quality management programs were more efficient but only when the programs had been implemented for at least 2 years. The responsibility centers system can also be effective when the system was associated with formal incentive schemes. The results indicate the importance of having both the individual-based and team-based incentives in place. Finally, the hospital-physician integration strategies appear to be effective individually, but the results change significantly when they are evaluated simultaneously, together with other control variables, in the tobit model. This indicates the importance of investigating hospital-physician integration strategies as a portfolio instead of a single tool.
The incidence of ICC continues to rise in the USA. The stable proportions over time of patients with early stage disease, unstaged disease, tumor size<5 cm, and microscopic confirmation suggest a true increase of ICC.
The results of this study indicate that recurrent ACS events are predicted by serum WBC counts, serum creatinine levels, and a diagnosis of periodontitis. Significantly higher counts of putative pathogens are found in subjects with ACS, but these counts do not predict future ACS events.
Our findings underline that survival in GBM patients is heterogeneous and influenced by multiple factors. This study confirms that tumor location with regard to the SVZ is significantly associated with survival.
Follow-up care by a nurse specialist for patients admitted with acute asthma can be delivered equivocally with comparable safety and effectiveness to that given by a doctor.
A conservative approach cannot be justified in suspected asthmatic children with possible FBA, in whom the indications for diagnostic bronchoscopy must be tailored to each patient to ensure a timely diagnosis.
The use of a portable canvas chair with standardised specifications offers an acceptable alternative to the use of a 'standard' chair in assessments of fall risk using the TUG test in field settings where field workers are reliant on public transport.
This preliminary study suggests that compensatory hypermetabolism can occur in aMCI subjects, particularly in those who are amyloid-negative. The increase in metabolic rate in different cortical regions with predominance in the occipital cortex may be a compensatory response to the neuronal damage occurring early in the disease process. It may also reflect recruitment of relatively minimally affected cortical regions to compensate for reduced function in the temporoparietal cortical association areas.
Biologic materials have made it such that ventral hernias can be safely repaired after bowel surgery without increased risk of complications.
The present data indicate that achieving a correct occlusal target does not necessarily correspond to a neuromuscular balance.
Erythrocyte indices and ferritin could not predict the iron needs of anemic pregnant women. Increases of Hb Z-scores after a short treatment with oral iron may be a reliable therapeutic test.
This finding suggests that high spasticity in the lower legs could indicate jaw movement restrictions in CP patients.
Results support the safety and efficacy of SG for morbid obesity in patients aged≥60 years. In contrast to weight loss, the long-term morbidity rate and remission of obesity-related co-morbidities were similar in the participants aged≥60 years and those aged<60 years.
PEI and RFA are equally effective in treating HCCs smaller than 2 cm in terms of 5-year survival, despite higher cumulative and local recurrence rates, in patients treated with PEI.
Preterm ventilated babies with U urealyticum in their tracheal secretions have a different clinical and radiological course, with less acute lung disease but early onset of CLD, compared with those with negative cultures.
Different phases of the menstrual cycle were unrelated to depression and mania in a heterogeneous group of women with bipolar disorder. Prospective studies are needed to identify a vulnerable subpopulation in a homogeneous clinical sample.
The question addressed here is whether the PPTg and NbM both have a role in sustained attention. Rats bearing lesions of either structure showed deficits in the test used. However, we conclude that the most parsimonious explanation for the deficit observed in PPTg rats is inadequate response organization, rather than impairment in sustained attention. Furthermore the impairment observed in NbM lesioned rats included lever pressing difficulties in addition to impaired sustained attention. Unfortunately we could not link these deficits directly to cholinergic neuronal loss.
The authors concluded that a short Pap interval (range, 15-120 days) does not significantly affect the quality of liquid-based repeat cytology, nor the viral load tested from a residual liquid-based specimen.
This result suggests that IHC with MLH1 and MSH2 antibodies does not seem to be a useful method to identify MSI in CRC, therefore PCR is required for detection of the MSI.
The use of a carbamide peroxide bleaching agent immediately before bonding significantly reduces the shear bond strength values of self-etching primer systems.
A diameter larger than 50mm, presence of a locoregional invasion and of metastases are strong arguments favouring.
Bipolar II disorder was the most prevalent affected phenotype in both bipolar I and bipolar II families and was the only expressed phenotype in half of the bipolar II families. This suggests that bipolar II disorder is genetically related to but less complex than bipolar I disorder. Accurate diagnosis of bipolar II disorder may be crucial in finding the genetic loci underlying bipolar disorders generally.
In this modern industrial cohort, hearing conservation efforts appear to be reducing hearing loss rates, especially at higher ambient noise levels. This could be related to differential use of hearing protection. The greatest burden of preventable occupational hearing loss was found in workers whose noise exposure averaged 85 dBA or less. To further reduce rates of occupational hearing loss, hearing conservation programmes may require innovative approaches targeting workers with noise exposures close to 85 dBA.
Results show that the inability to defend carbon dioxide during exercise is associated with a more rapid decline in lung function.
In view of these findings, standard preoperative strategies to prepare these patients for operation may prove unsuccessful, because minimizing the incidence of anastomotic leaks will have little overall impact on survival. In addition, efforts to accomplish early hospital discharge may prove hazardous, because many of these patients manifest their leaks later in the postoperative period than is generally assumed. Improved management of GI tract disruption, including aggressive attempts at diagnosis, ICU care, antibiotics, and nutritional support may further increase survival in these patients.
The prevalence of proximal proliferative colonic lesions seems to have increased over the last decade, particularly in males.
Treatment assignment may influence outcome of symptomatic patients with AS.
MR elastography demonstrated excellent performance for distinguishing the stages of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic HBV infection. For hepatic tissue with ≤ F2 fibrosis, necroinflammation can account for a substantial fraction of the increase in hepatic stiffness.
Although this is a low volume study, there is evidence to suggest that asymptomatic patients with low EDV in the setting of carotid artery pseudo-occlusion found of duplex, may be safely managed medically.
This report suggests that LAARP is a feasible approach for ARM, although urethral diverticulum is a major concern. It may evolve without complications, and eventually resolve spontaneously. Active surveillance might be an option in selected asymptomatic patients; however a longer follow-up is advised to constitute better evidence supporting that policy.
Opportunities remain for improvement in diabetes care. Large variations in care among states were reduced significantly by adjustment for characteristics of state residents. However, much variability remained unexplained. Variability of measures within states and variable impact of the adjustment variables argues against systems effects operating with uniformity on the three measures. These findings suggest that a single approach to quality improvement is unlikely to be effective. Further understanding variability will be important to improving quality.
Replacing the Double-J stent with a ureteral catheter in tubeless PCNL is an effective procedure and can be performed in patients with a moderate stone burden. The electrocauterization of the bleeding points at the end of percutaneous renal surgery with a rollerball resectoscope is safe.
The mean CD4 count among normal south Indians is significantly lower than that in the western population and parallels that of the Chinese. When categorized based on the CDC classification system, the mean CD4 count of HIV-infected individuals was lower. Categories of CD4 counts>300, 81-300 and<or =80 cells/microl and CD4%>14, 7-14 and<or = 6 correlate better with disease progression among HIV-infected individuals. A longitudinal study is required before guidelines for the Indian population can be devised.
Persistent involvement by the GP is associated with improved end-of-life care for cancer patients. Provided that temporal relations are taken into account, the mortality follow-back design can be a suitable and ethical research method to highlight and monitor end-of-life cancer care.
This study shows that: (i) historical material can be still employed usefully, and (ii) the FTH-phenotype corresponds to a broad spectrum of PTCLs that might form a new category to be validated in future molecular and clinicopathological analyses.
An increased permeability-index points towards an increased risk of development of proliferative retinopathy.
Our results show that patients operated on by thoracic surgeons have higher acuity compared with patients operated on by general surgeons. When patients are matched for comorbidities and serious preoperative risk factors, thoracic surgeons have improved outcomes, especially with regard to infectious complications and composite morbidity.
We suggest that the handmade endo-loop technique is a safe, applicable, and cost-effective method to be used in the closure of appendiceal stump.
In a highly homogeneous group of morbidly obese patients with one-year follow-up, CHL and short-term parenteral nutrition did not lead to significant or sustained LBM preservation or modification in EBWL. There was no significant decrease in complications or length of stay. Our study confirms the safety of these interventions, even in previously unstudied Type 2 diabetic patients.
These results provide the foundation for future studies of mimicry, which should integrate phylogenetic and developmental analyses of wing pattern formation. We propose future analyses of character evolution accommodate conflicting phylogenetic estimates by explicitly testing alternative evolutionary hypotheses.
The failure of poisons affecting the cytoskeleton to inhibit the replication of a diverse set of viruses strongly suggests that viruses do not require a functional cytoskeletal system for replication, either because they do not utilize it or are able to utilize alternate pathways when it is not available.
A BED>220 Gy does not seem to increase morbidity.
Given the high correlation between PT and SFP angle, the SFP angle should be considered a reliable alternative option to PT, which has routinely excellent visibility in coronal films in AIS patients. The predictability was more accurate for AIS patients with thoracic curves than with lumbar curves.
Each biopsy was associated with a significant risk of complications compared to randomly selected controls. However, the repeat biopsy procedure itself was not associated with a greater risk of serious complications requiring hospital admission compared to the initial biopsy.
The paradoxical increase in invasive infections caused by NVSTs in these populations with different vaccine use suggests that these changes were not driven only by PCV7.
Breast MRI could be recommended as a pre-surgical diagnostic procedure in patients allocated to breast conservation surgery. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine if preoperative breast MRI leads to a decrease in tumor recurrence and in overall survival.
These data corroborate that induced hypertension may be a safe treatment option to prevent cerebral infarction in CVS, even in the presence of unsecured aneurysms. Our findings suggest that induced hypertension does not increase rupture of unsecured aneurysms. Given the high risk for cerebral infarction in severe CVS, we conclude that induced hypertension should not be omitted due to the presence of unsecured aneurysms.
According to our findings, MRCDs seem to increasing the maternal and neonatal morbidity even though they are not life-threatening.
Cortical excitability increases in migraine suggesting the involvement of intracortical inhibitory circuits. This may be a common feature underlying some of the similarities observed in migraine and epilepsy.
The data suggest that the nature of the cytotoxic effect of I and whether it leads to apoptotic or necrotic cell death is dose-dependent. High I doses seem to produce mainly necrotic phenomena, whereas at low I activity concentrations apoptotic phenomena prevail. The predominance of delayed apoptosis could explain why radioiodine therapy at lower doses is often linked to delayed onset and possible continuation of thyroid volume reduction over some months and even up to a year.
Although protecting the recipient's right to privacy is paramount, the donor is still entitled to consider factors a priori that could alter their decision to donate. This can be accomplished by informing the donor that they are not entitled to protected health information of the recipient and that their decision to donate should be based on knowing the recipient is medically appropriate for kidney transplantation.
The CCKNOW scores were comparable in cases and controls. Thus, in a retrospective study, no evidence has been demonstrated of an association between patient knowledge and the risk of developing colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis. However, knowledge may have been increased in cases as a direct result of having had colorectal cancer as a complication of ulcerative colitis.
Our findings suggest that BNP is more sensitive but less specific than TnT in the diagnostic assessment of acute chest pain. However, combining BNP and TnT was a very satisfactory rule out test (negative predictive accuracy 96%) for excluding chest pain that had a cardiac origin.
Menopause seems to negatively affect SSRI treatment response of depressed women treated in PC.
If the results of this small pilot study are confirmed in larger studies, then measuring QT peak of lead I may become a cost-effective way of identifying hypertensives who are likely to have echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy.
Even despite precise surgical technique including pressurized irrigation, a significant amount of debris is still present after TKA. The debris consists predominantly of bone and cement particles. The presence of metal debris is limited, and contributes only 1.5% to the total amount.
Nationally, there is apparent progress in reducing Black-White disparities; this is not true for Chicago. Whether failure to reduce racial disparities is unique to Chicago or is common to other urban centers remains an open question with important implications.
Prospective studies should explore the source of these risk differences.
Despite methodologic limitations of the study, the findings suggest that burnout levels may be increasing among primary care physicians in Israel. This may be due to substantial increases in workload and role conflicts following implementation of the Health Insurance Law and Patients' Rights Act. Because these findings are consistent with the trend in Europe, this situation cannot be ignored and systematic studies of burnout among all medical specialties should be carried out to uncover current sources of the syndrome and to devise measures of prevention and treatment.
Pretreatment ADC values may be an independent predictor of bladder cancer recurrence.
Residents are less likely to perform DRE during an evaluation for GIB and to accurately identify melena based on stool color or DRE findings. There appears to be a need to educate residents on the appropriate terminology for stool color and the importance of DRE to accurately triage patients with acute GIBs.
We found a comparatively high prevalence rate of chlamydia-positive patients (11.4%) in our publicly funded pregnancy termination clinic. Because of infrequent follow-up in this patient population, we suggest screening and providing the epidemiologic treatment for CT genital infection for all women undergoing a same-day abortion procedure. It may prove cost-effective. Our prevalence rate of gonorrhea was lower (2.6%). The value of providing epidemiologic treatment for gonorrhea to all patients undergoing a same-day abortion procedure should be reexamined in controlled trials.
There appears to be a lack of emphasis on the training of F2 doctors in practical safe prescribing compared with F1 doctors. There should be standardisation of safe prescribing training provisions, particularly in the induction period and for F2 doctors.
A significant number of patients undergoing routine EGD and colonoscopy are at risk for OSA. SB+ patients are not at higher risk for AI or SRAE. However, other risk factors for AI and SRAE have been identified and must be taken into account to optimize patient safety.
Atrial resynchronisation therapy is effective in the long term management of drug-resistant AF in patients unsuitable for LA ablation, leading to significant reductions in symptoms, AF duration, admissions and AAD.
The metabolic syndrome as a single underlying factor for the four simple phenotypic traits may be plausible in adolescents. The proposed model appears to be generalizable across sex and race/ethnicity.
Conventional AVR as a redo procedure after CABG with patent grafts can be performed with excellent results and lower mortality than estimated. Results of newer catheter-based AVR approaches should not to be compared with artificial scores to justify high morbidity rates.
It appears that diabetes and its complications affect patients' valuation of health states. Hence, the EQ-5D-3L health-state values based on the general population may underestimate the utility of health interventions for T2DM.
Risk for MD resulting from environmental and psychosocial factors may also predispose individuals to GAD, and less consistently, other anxiety disorders. Presentations of MD with certain phobias display distinguishably different patterns of risk, however, and are therefore likely qualitatively distinct.
BMI, high levels of TC and TG, and low HDL-C levels appear to be more important than hormonal status in their impact on hemostatic variables in healthy postmenopausal women.
The congruence of keratoconus classification was very poor of all the techniques tested in our study. This applies to objective measures such as TKC, KMP as well as clinical classification techniques such as Amsler and retinoscopy. Compared to TKC and KMP, retinoscopy underestimates keratoconus stages. In contrast, the performance of binary decisions (normal vs. keratoconus) shows a high sensitivity and specificity. Retinoscopy, however, showed a clear clinical use in confirming the diagnosis of keratoconus.
Our study suggests a substantial increase in both the use of ecstasy and related substances as well as hallucinogens. The data further suggest that the increase is strongest in younger age groups, but the risk of first use of these substances continues to be present up to the age of 24 years. The higher proportion of women contributing to this increase is noteworthy.
Presence of an ED CT scanner is associated with decreases in time to CT scan completion, radiologic interpretation, and patient disposition.
An imperceptible IVC at the point of maximal contact with a retroperitoneal mass was the most useful CT feature for predicting the origin of IVC leiomyosarcoma. A negative embedded organ sign was useful for excluding IVC origin. Knowledge of these CT features may assist with preoperative planning.
This study suggests that the 14-gauge, 1.5-inch angiocatheter used for ND in the midaxillary line may partially and temporarily occlude in patients who will be transported on military stretchers. The pressure of 12.8 mm Hg has been documented in animal models as the pressure at which hemodynamic instability develops. This may contribute to the reaccumulation of tension pneumothoraces and ultimate patient deterioration in military transport.
The more frequent reports of shoulder pain in the supermarket cashiers are not correlated with a higher prevalence of imaging abnormalities. The causes of these more frequent complaints should be probably sought in the psycho-social and occupational environment.
Our data suggest that liver transplantation had an important effect on the improvement in these patients.
With long fusions to the sacrum, one should anticipate more perioperative complications, a higher pseudarthrosis rate, and perhaps more revision surgery than short fusions. Short fusions may result in a more proximal junctional kyphosis, only rarely requiring revision surgery.
This study suggested that SC, particularly the TE type, might be significantly and independently associated with AO and could be considered a risk factor in predicting AO.
In the range between 40 and 70 bpm, an increase in basic pacing rate enhances CO without reducing SV. According to this pilot study, a basic pacing rate between 60 and 70 bpm would appear reasonable.
Whole-body MSCT is not sufficient as the sole diagnostic tool in hemodynamically instable trauma patients requiring resuscitation and needs to be complemented by a conventional x-ray unit for emergency diagnosis of the chest.
Previous high grade intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical small acinar proliferation, digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen slope were independent predictors of prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. Race approached but did not attain significance after adjusting for disease features.
This study shows that the Sørensen test performed until failure in a young healthy population results in a reduced ability of the trunk extensor muscles to generate maximal force, and indicates that this test is valid for the assessment of fatigue in trunk extensor muscles.
Salbutamol plasma concentrations were influenced by age group of the patients submitted to inhalation therapy, even with doses adjusted for body weight. After correcting for the differences in the biovailabilities of the delivery systems, the concentrations were independent of the aerosol delivery device used.
Our report of two sisters with NPH may indicate the presence of genetic predisposition and further studies involving genetics and environmental factors are necessary to elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of NPH.
Based on survey responses, physicians were equally willing to offer an ICD to men and women and to whites and blacks, but were less likely to offer an ICD to an older patient even when indicated by practice guidelines. Electrophysiologists (EPs) more often adhered to practice guideline recommendations on ICD therapy compared with non-EPs.
Only Ki-67 and anti-VIII factor were shown to be useful for the prediction of outcome and recurrence rate in curatively treated CC patients. In conjunction with clinical and pathological staging, they may provide a stronger indication of clinical outcome than staging alone and help better select therapeutic options in CC patients.
This study provides evidence that the chronologic age is not a contra-indication for surgical palliation of periampullary neoplasms and that surgery provides a better quality of residual life.
There is no significant relationship between mean SST during lumbar facet radiofrequency denervation and treatment outcome, which may be due to differences in general sensory perception. Because stimulation threshold was optimized for each patient, these data cannot be interpreted to suggest that sensory testing should not be performed, or that high sensory stimulation thresholds obtained on the first attempt should be deemed acceptable.
Adjuvant hormonotherapy enhances neither anxiety nor depression, does not impair cognitive function but has a negative effect on the patients' sexual function. It does not worsen self-rated quality of relationship and quality of life.
Since the number of chemotherapeutic agents is steadily increasing, much attention should be paid to such reactions, particularly when several administrations are performed daily, and where management of the potential risk associated with specific drugs is mandatory. Their occurrence represents an unpredictable, unexpected and often hard to manage contingency, and our opinion is that observation and consciousness of this issue are fundamental for its appropriate management. We describe our experience, emphasizing the role of this toxicity and explaining how this awareness allowed us to define some empirical rules to handle acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Routine pelvic ultrasound examinations are not necessary before insertion of the LNG-IUS for menstrual suppression in adolescents with DD. Renal abnormalities, obstructive symptoms, and very small stature might necessitate imaging. Insertion using anesthesia is often straightforward and successful with minimal complications.
Formal assessment of these features as emergency signs to improve triage and to rationalize manpower resources toward the high-risk groups is required. In addition, basic clinical research is necessary to identify and test appropriate supportive treatments.
Although overall ED utilization did not change significantly between program participants and nonparticipants, TAP patients had a lower rate of ED visits not resulting in inpatient admission relative to the comparison group.
Co-existence of SCLE with RA should be considered in some patients. The role of TNF-α antagonists and rituximab therapy in induction of idiopathic form of SCLE requires further investigations.
From these data, a surgeon performing a direct vertebral derotation using a 30 cm (12 in) lever would need to apply roughly 40 N (9 lbs) to causeanatomic failure. Adolescent patients would likely tolerate a greater force without bone failure given a greater bone density, yet, extreme caution is still recommended to prevent screw rotation either medially into the spinal canal or laterally into the chest.
We conclude that plethysmographic measurements of functional venous parameters (VFI,EF) do not discriminate well between limbs with uncomplicated varicose veins and limbs with ulcers or stasis dermatitis and that VFI correlates poorly with the presence of incompetent veins and their diameters. Both duplex scanning and plethysmography seem to be necessary for a complete evaluation of limbs with chronic venous insufficiency.
The GraftConnector provides a consistent and reproducible coronary artery anastomosis and reduces technical demand and manual dexterity in coronary operations. Long-term results demonstrate that off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting performed with the GraftConnector had the same patency rate and luminal width as those performed with running suture.
Male sexual response was not represented by the linear model for men with or without MSD, excluding possible healthy responsive desire. The circular model provided a better fit for the two groups of men but demonstrated that the relations between psychological factors and phases of sexual response were different for men with and without MSD as currently defined.
Although graft-tunnel motion was only measured in cadaveric animals, results suggest that healing may be affected by the local mechanical environment, as graft healing in the femoral tunnel was inversely proportional to the magnitude of graft-tunnel motion.
The possible clinical usefulness of preoperative assessment of DD suggested by previous studies has not been confirmed by our data. CEA was confirmed to be the most reliable and valid indicator of prognosis.
Without curve flexibility taken into consideration, implant density is positively correlated with thoracolumbar or lumbar coronal Cobb curve correction. No significant correlation is found between screw density and correction index, if the effect of the flexibility was eliminated. There was no association between implant density and magnitude of sagittal curve correction before and after surgery.
Except for children whose motor skills regress substantially, children with dynamic developmental delays are less likely than their peers with persistent delays to receive EI. This finding suggests the need for improved understanding of developmental surveillance, referral, and use of EI services.
One-year clinical outcomes in ACS patients treated with BVS were similar to non-ACS patients. Acute angiographic outcomes were better in ACS than in non-ACS, yet the early thrombotic events require attention and further research.
TN breast cancer is a rare subtype with a high proliferation rate and a high nuclear grade, p53 overexpression, and lower DFS/OS. To improve the prognosis of TN breast cancer, a new effective strategy needs to be developed.
Thermoplastic mask-related anxiety is low and possibly lies in the positive representation patients have about the mask. The explanations provided by health professionals on the radiotherapy mask possibly have a very positive effect on this perception.
The removal of a greater number of regional, uninvolved cervical lymph nodes does not correlate with disease-free survival in this particular cohort of patients.
We have found RPP without previous staging lymphadenectomy to be a valid therapeutic option for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, preoperative PSA<or = 10 ng/ml and a Gleason score of<or = 7. According to our data, this group accounts for approximately 40% of the patients in whom radical prostatectomy had been recommended.
It was surprising to note that the loss of proprioception in patients with meniscus injuries did not influence postural stability. Patients with functional knee instability must therefore be examined for the presence of further injuries because a meniscal lesion alone cannot explain instability symptoms.
We conclude that previously observed regional variation in T1ρ values of normal hips is altered in hips with cam morphology. No difference in T1ρ values between symptomatic and asymptomatic cam hips was demonstrated. Therefore, regardless of the presence of hip pain, a cam deformity may predispose to hip joint cartilage degradation and increase the risk of hip osteoarthritis.
The SCL-90-R may be a useful instrument to predict relapse. As our study indicates that high levels of psychological distress increases the risk of relapse, specific interventions may be targeted at this risk factor.
Whereas a large percentage of pregnant Jordanian women were aware of folic acid, only a small proportion are aware that it prevents NTDs and should be taken periconceptionally. Also, there was a gap between awareness, knowledge, and intake of folic acid. Awareness and knowledge of NTDs was less prevalent among Jordanian women. Despite the efforts that have been undertaken, further effort is required to educate Jordanian women about folic acid contribution to NTDs prevention.
Propofol MCT/LCT and propofol LCT premixed with lignocaine are both associated with pain on injection in children; the incidence and intensity of the injection pain are similar.
The relation between C pneumoniae and clinically manifest atherosclerosis is not durable. This probably is due to a lack of causality, although results may have been influenced by the design of the component studies.
These findings show that the DLs could be considered as indicators of cognitive functioning in ASD.
The results have significant implications for quality improvement in the NHS. The finding that some NHS providers consistently perform better than others suggests that there are system-wide determinants of patient experience and the potential for learning from innovators. However, there is room for improvement overall. Given the large samples of these surveys, the messages could also have relevance for healthcare systems elsewhere.
In pregnancy, negative affect was a predictor of postpartum depression, whereas positive affect showed a protective role. Future studies are required to explore whether psychotherapeutic strategies focusing on decreasing negative affect and enhancing positive affect in the last trimester of pregnancy can reduce the risk of postpartum depression.
Medical records are of limited use in assessing the appropriate management of care. The process of care should therefore be evaluated prospectively.
Leakage cannot be reliably predicted at the vesico-urethral anastomosis. Cystograms are necessary to identify clinically significant leaks at 8 days and should be taken if early catheter removal is being considered.
The results of this study argue for a participatory role of psychosomatic factors in the assumed multifactorial etiology of interstitial cystitis.
Para-aortic lymphadenectomy might be avoided by the negativity of such lymph nodes, thereby minimizing post-operative complications.
Results indicate the stressor criterion as defined by the DSM may not be informative in characterizing PTSD symptoms and sequelae. In the context of ongoing DSM-5 revision, these results suggest that criterion A1 could be expanded in DSM-5 without much consequence for our understanding of PTSD phenomenology. Events not considered qualifying stressors under the DSM produced PTSD as consequential as PTSD following DSM-III events, suggesting PTSD may be an aberrantly severe but nonspecific stress response syndrome.
Our findings suggest that MALT lymphoma of the lung is a very indolent disease with the potential for spontaneous regression. In view of this, patients diagnosed with pulmonary MALT lymphoma might not require immediate treatment in the absence of symptoms and a watch-and-wait policy could be adopted.
A mechanical bone measurement tool like the DensiProbe™ seems to be suitable for predicting tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis failure in a biomechanical test set-up. As a restriction in clinical practice failure is multifactorial and prediction cannot be based upon these measurements only.
In a real-life setting,>40% of subjects with mild/moderate asthma are currently treated by protocols based on the results of RCTs for which they would not have been eligible. This proportion increases in elderly patients with comorbidities. These findings limit the generalizability of RCTs and advocate that complementary pragmatic studies be conducted. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.
We observed only modest exercise-induced improvements of multiple diabetes-related cytokines. Circulating levels of FFAs were significantly lowered in the T2D-group.
Among preterm newborns, the odds of survival without major morbidity improved by 5% and mortality (8%), necrotizing enterocolitis (11%), and sepsis (9%) reduced as maternal age group increased by 5 years.
We confirmed in this study the high frequency of DQ2 haplotype in CD patients and we identified new protective alleles DRB1*13, DQA1*0102 and DQB1*06. However, HLA polymorphism seems to have no evident impact on clinical outcome of CD.
Since enterectomy prior to the onset of hemorrhage does not prevent or attenuate the reduced ICG clearance and elevated liver enzymes despite downregulation of TNF production, it appears that the small intestine does not play a significant role in producing hepatocellular dysfunction and injury following trauma and hemorrhagic shock.
The increase in epilepsy information-seeking behavior in the Saint Nicholas period is possibly caused by an increased occurrence of epileptic seizures. This underscores the potential of health information-seeking behavior on the Internet to answer clinically relevant research questions and provides circumstantial evidence for a relation between stress and the occurrence of epileptic seizures.
Though the idea of primary anastomosis with on table lavage for left sided anastomosis seems attractive, we think the Hartmann procedure is still useful for selected patients.
This study represents a snapshot of rural health facilities providing maternal and neonatal care in Tanzania. Enhancing knowledge, practical skills, and clinical leadership of ACs may have a positive impact on health outcomes. However, any impact may be confounded by the significant challenges in delivering a service in terms of resources. Thus, training may be beneficial, but it requires an infrastructure that supports it.
High-signal changes of the alar and transverse ligaments close after injury did not affect outcome for acute WAD1-2 patients without previous neck problems. High-resolution upper neck MRI has limited value for the initial examination and follow-up of such patients.
Weightbearing and nonweightbearing ankle dorsiflexion measurements produce significantly different results and only a moderate correlation, suggesting that these two measurements should not be used interchangeably as measures of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion.
The PPS performs well as a predictor of prognosis in a heterogeneous hospice population, and performs particularly well for nursing home residents and for patients with non-cancer diagnoses. The PPS should be useful in confirming hospice eligibility for reimbursement purposes and in guiding plans for hospice care.
RIC allo-HCT is a reasonable option for patients with high-risk CLL. However, these results require confirmation before the procedure can be recommended outside clinical trials.
Continuous monitoring of outcomes using an EWMA chart may have advantages over other techniques. Had data been available, analysis with an EWMA chart might have prompted review of processes and outcomes among patients at Bundaberg Base Hospital ICU.
Our data do not support a cross-sectional association between lung disease and risk of early AMD.
Our study concludes that female sex is an independent prognostic factor for cutaneous head and neck melanoma. We demonstrated better 5-year DSS in female compared to male patients. Better prognosis could be due to multiple factors including differing hair, levels of sun exposure, and advanced male age.
Data from our study do not show any association between T1D in children and gallstones formation, with diabetes duration of less than 8 years. The relatively short duration of diabetes and possibility that our study was underpowered might have been reasons for the absence of any association.
BRAF mutation is an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with stage III melanoma with a positive sentinel lymph node. BRAF status could be used in the staging of this population. BRAF has a role not only in cellular immortalization but also in metastatic spread.
These findings do not support the notion of different cognitive functioning because of differences in intelligence of these two groups. In the ongoing discussion about the role of intelligence (especially as to the postulated discrepancy between intelligence and school achievement in diagnosis and special education), our findings might lead to rethinking the current practice of treating these two groups as fundamentally different.
Danish health care registries can provide data for explicit pDRA-indicators in diabetes. However, the validity is reduced as laboratory data and data on actual medicine use are not being registered.
The nature of complications changed with experience, but no significant variation in the incidence was observed over the 9-year period of experience with hip arthroscopy.
Occult cancer was identified in 5% of PMs. PM with or without SLNB spared only 4 of 393 patients (1%) from undergoing ALND, whereas PM alone identified unsuspected invasive disease in 3 of 136 patients (2%). When performed, MRI accurately ruled out the presence of an invasive cancer in the prophylactic breast, suggesting that MRI can be used to select patients for PM without SLNB.
This study indicates that there is no significant difference between TRUS guidance and digital guidance to direct systematic biopsies of the prostate. The use of routine TRUS in screening programmes is now in doubt.
The clinical significance of these findings is limited, but it needs to be considered in future research. Abstinence from smoking may, however, be a useful means of primary prevention of certain types of LBP.
Quality improvement efforts aimed at increasing advice and education provision in diabetes management in primary care could target also perceptions of procedural justice.
Insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin are released by insulinoma cells in response to arterial calcium stimulation, whereas CgA and NSE are not released. Also from our study it seems that PP may be released by healthy islet cells after calcium stimulation.
Growth retardation in late gestation, leading to shortness at birth and low weight gain in infancy, may be associated with a reduced number of primordial follicles in the ovary leading in turn to an earlier menopause.
Glucose and insulin concentrations show no increase from 4-8 am; although there is variability in GH, there is no evidence for the dawn phenomenon in late pregnancy in healthy women.
The right anterolateral thoracotomy associated with aortic cannulation in mitral valve surgery is a simple technique, reproducible and safety.
Visual inspection of lipemic, icteric and hemolyzed samples is highly unreliable and should be replaced by automated systems that report serum indices.
HRQOL measured in dialysis patients was associated with survival and graft function after RTX. These findings may be useful in clinical pretransplant evaluations. Improvements in some of the kidney-specific HRQOL domains from dialysis to RTX were associated with lower mortality. Prospective and interventional studies are warranted.
Patients with complete response to induction chemotherapy in laryngeal carcinoma have a high probability of cure after hyperfractionation radiotherapy. However, hyperfractionation radiotherapy induces a high degree of toxicity that reduces the laryngeal function preservation rate and may jeopardize overall survival.
FR and FRI do not seem to be helpful in routine colorectal practice for evaluating the strength of the external anal sphincter.
The increased risk of premature death associated with ipratropium is of concern and necessitates further evaluation, e.g., in a randomised study.
Graduate entry programmes can contribute to increased student diversity, but are unlikely to have much impact without other strategies to reinforce this aim. A nationwide collaboration could provide opportunities for research to establish more efficient and effective ways of selecting tomorrow's doctors.
Findings argue for a more optimistic perspective on treating Type Bs, and for the utility of Type A-Type B in informing treatment research.
We conclude that among Swiss gynecologists, sexual problems are regarded as an important issue in gynecological outpatient care, but addressing patients' sexuality is not yet part of routine practice. Swiss gynecologists seem to be most likely to consider hormonal changes (although not so much those due to oral contraceptives) to necessitate discussion of sexual health issues, while psychosocial transitions or stress seem to be considered less important.
Inguinal exploration is an unreliable method of investigating the impalpable testis, with an unacceptably high incidence of false-negative or inconclusive findings. Laparoscopy should be undertaken as the initial diagnostic manoeuvre of choice.
The results prove residual antibody-binding capacity of alpha-amylase in bread crusts and in the crust of some rolls. In comparison with the content of alpha-amylase in dough, between 0.1 and 20% of the antibody-binding capacity remained.
Agreement between patient's reports and nursing records was moderate to low. A higher proportion of similar answers were observed when the patients related good oral feeding or NPO.
We suggest that PRES in non-pregnant patients and eclampsia presenting with MRI abnormalities similar to those seen in PRES represent the same disease entity, but are triggered by different pathologies.
The present findings suggest that ESDS may decrease the incidence of developing MD in silent endolymphatic hydronic contralateral ears diagnosed with G-test and ECoG within the first 5 postoperative years.
Ultrathin endoscopy through both the transnasal and oral routes has limited use in routine outpatient practice. Techniques for reducing pain and gagging may improve patient tolerance. Further technical improvements are needed to allow routine implementation.
No differences were found between 1-stage and 2-stage implant placement in crestal bone loss after 1 year of functional loading.
The 2013 SOGC guideline on GBS prophylaxis recommends antibiotic therapy in women with PPROM for both latency and prevention of GBS-related neonatal sepsis. This clinically relevant evaluation in a select preterm group demonstrated that type of antibiotic regimen did not influence either latency with PPROM and GBS positive culture or rates of neonatal sepsis. Ongoing evaluation of serious neonatal outcomes is essential in view of this new recommendation.
Our national dataset demonstrates that NEC onset occurs in an inverse stereotypic, linear relationship with gestational age at birth. Medical NEC is the most reliable sub-cohort for the purpose of determining the temporal window of NEC risk.
The higher the skin type category, the better the protection in the visible part of the spectrum of the sun. This stimulates the hot discussion at the present time, as to whether sunscreens should also contain protection compounds in the visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum.
The results from this ecological study are associations and do not establish a causal relationship between having an STD/FP clinic and improved STD detection and control. Finer level analyses (such as census block or cities) may be able to provide more detail information.
This study did not find a large effect of prevalence information on most visual search metrics or polyp identification in CTC. Further research is required to quantify effects at lower prevalence and in relation to secondary outcome measures.
We conclude that, in making the differential diagnosis between occlusion and pseudo-occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery, contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a second-generation contrast agent is significantly more effective than conventional Doppler ultrasound and is equally as effective as the gold standard (computed tomography angiography). Our findings suggest that contrast-enhanced ultrasound could replace computed tomography angiography in this regard.
Our data support the value of the AASI as an indirect estimate of AS and as an element in the evaluation of CV risk in hypertensive patients. However, the reproducibility of this index is less, and its predictive value for complications is poorer, than that of QKD100-60, a parameter that we believe is more closely linked to AS.
Sampaio type B1 PCSs require increased number of access for achieving stone clearance. Therefore, surgeons should be aware and also inform patients that treatment of patients with Sampaio type B1 PCS may need high number of access during PNL procedure.
In contrast to calculated values, direct measurement revealed LDL to be much more stable (the s.d. being an order of magnitude) in T2DM patients taking atorvastatin rather than simvastatin. This means LDL targets can be consistently met with less lipid monitoring using atorvastatin rather than simvastatin. Direct LDL measurement may therefore have a particular role in monitoring patients on statin treatment.
Teachers can successfully promote their pupils' ToM development during their regular teaching hours. Results are discussed in the light of the importance of ToM promotion for children's school adjustment.
There were significant differences in the financial costs and benefits for a teaching rural practice compared with an urban teaching practice. With infrastructure costs which include accommodation, being a key contributor to the difference found, it might be time to review the level of incentives paid to practices in this area. If not addressed, this cost difference might be a disincentive for rural practices to participate in teaching.
A smoking cessation and prevention programme targeted to female high school students in a dental setting provides a novel means of delivering an anti-smoking message and educating adolescents of the health-risk effects of smoking.
Addition of the topical placental extract was seen to have a modest but a statistically insignificant effect on the efficacy of NB-UVB therapy in causing repigmentation in vitiligo.
Calf muscle spasticity and weakness differently contribute to postural imbalance in patients with HSP. This notion could have implications for the clinical management of spasticity.
These findings suggest that age-related reductions in myonuclear domain size could be explained by the greater proportion of small fibers. The data also highlight the usefulness of determining fiber-size-based clusters for gaining mechanistic insight into the relationship between skeletal muscle fiber size and myonuclear content.
The need for reduction among children with forearm fractures is significantly associated with male sex and major mechanisms of trauma but not with high weight status. Strategies to reduce severe forearm fractures should focus on preventing major mechanisms of trauma.
Even in a young population with type 2 diabetes, osteoporotic fractures were not uncommon. New use of sitagliptin was not associated with fracture, but other commonly used second-line agents for type 2 diabetes were associated with increased risk. These data should be considered when making treatment decisions for those with type 2 diabetes at particularly high risk of fractures.
The notable incidences of radiographic dysplasia after previous DDH normalization in our study cohort appear to outweigh the risks of radiation exposure. Our findings may warrant radiographic follow-up in this population of infants through at least walking age to allow timely diagnosis and early intervention of residual acetabular dysplasia.
Dynamin may facilitate Fas-mediated apoptotic death in the brain, and Hsp70 may protect by preventing this trafficking. Dynamin should be explored as a new therapeutic target for neuroprotection.
In approximately half of cases the diagnosis of colorectal cancer is not associated with anaemia. Anaemia is more common with proximal lesions but this is not a consistent finding. The current threshold for anaemia at which national guidelines suggest referral also appears to be insensitive.
In our early RA patients, cigarette smoking was associated with increased disease activity, and severity, independently of several other possible confounders and despite the early disease treatment.
The women students clearly outperformed the men students during the clinical clerkship on obstetrics and gynecology. The reasons for this are not immediately apparent. Further investigation is necessary.
Evaluation of LUTD in children is not complying with the current guidelines. General approach for those children needs to be revisited by the clinicians.
The results of this study suggest that the routinary clinic use of piezoelectric dental scalers do not interfere with the functioning of any of the tested ICDs.
The results may suggest that lower self-efficacy among employees with sickness absence is a result of the sickness absence itself rather than a precursor of it. This indicates a need to investigate the potential change in self-efficacy in relation to the employee's change in labor market status; this will help to focus Return-to-Work interventions where planning has to be attentive towards the change in self-efficacy that can occur after onset of disease and sickness absence.
Larger tumor deposits and more metastases are identified by more extensive sectioning of the sentinel lymph nodes. None of the patients was false-negative due to histopathologic sampling error, but the results indicate that central step-sectioning of the central 1000 microM cannot completely be relied upon for accurate staging of the patients.
The addition of a falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue to standard stapled or sutured remnant closure did not reduce the rate or severity of pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00889213).
We found a differential relationship between negative and cognitive symptoms in different stages of schizophrenia. Illness duration should be considered when studying the relationship between negative symptoms and cognition.
The timing of cranioplasty following posttraumatic craniectomy was not related to the neurological outcomes of TBI. Despite the limitations of the retrospective design, the analyses provide preliminary information to elucidate the question.
More than 25% of the students from the Jagiellonian University of Kraków did not know or accept the concept of brain death.
The results indicate that although students benefited from the asthma program delivered in elementary school, they need booster sessions and continued school support in middle school.
People do not think that all quality-adjusted life-years are created equal. Instead, the value that people place on treatment programs depends on patients' state of health before developing life-threatening illnesses, and on whether alternative treatments are available that provide better health outcomes for the patients. These results may explain, in part, public discomfort over basing health care priorities on cost-utility analysis.
Our results show that the pharmacists' opinions are associated with their practice of counseling. Therefore, any program designed with the purpose of changing dispensing habits of the pharmacists should identify and take into account their opinions.
Prophylaxis is safe in cirrhotic patients without esophageal varices; the real need for prophylaxis should be better assessed.
Prior studies have shown that SI fluctuations in MRI time series data correspond to the presence of physiological "noise," which includes vasomotion, an autoregulatory phenomenon that affects the tissue response to ischemia. In this study, SI fluctuations were found to decrease in ischemia, consistent with the notion that small vessels will remain open (fluctuations in vessel diameter will decrease) when there is a challenge to flow. Spatial variation in SI fluctuations appeared to be different from spatial variation seen on other perfusion-based metrics, suggesting that a separate contrast mechanism is responsible, one that might be of diagnostic and prognostic value in acute stroke in which the ability of tissue to withstand ischemia is currently not well visualized.
Compared with the LD and MD strata, the HD stratum patients had more exacerbations and a shorter time to first exacerbation. However, there were no differences in response between the 1 × 2 and 2 × 2 groups in any of the strata. This indicates that patients using budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, irrespective of baseline ICS dose, can be switched to 1 × 2 with its lower steroid load. ACQ(5) scores improved more in the HD stratum than in the MD and LD strata indicating, among other things, that HD patients were not overtreated at baseline.
There could be gender differences in the beneficial effects of exercise training on the potent CV risk factors of BP and body weight, but not on hsCRP.
Though only two calendar years were monitored, we believe that the biennial RSV cycle in Croatia occurs independently of the dominant viral subtype.
The atherosclerotic plaque developed in the current model is predominantly composed of macrophages expressing metalloproteinases with few smooth muscle cells (SMC)--a characteristic of vulnerable plaque. The animal model presented in this study can elucidate at least part of the mechanism of plaque vulnerability and could be used to test treatment modalities to test plaque stability.
The yield of advanced colonic neoplasia was substantially higher in patients with acute diverticulitis than in asymptomatic, average-risk individuals. Colonoscopy verification is warranted in patients with diverticulitis detected on CT, especially in those aged 50 years or older.
Our results reveal the existence of a specific vasodilatory effect of mobile phone radiofrequency emission on skin perfusion.
Follow-up phone calls improved response rates among black subjects only.
In postmenopausal women, pravastatin decreases plasma concentrations of remnant lipoproteins by a mechanism that may relate chiefly to inhibition of remnant production, but this requires further evaluation.
Our results suggest that dexpanthenol administration through IP may reduce peritoneal adhesion formation probably by altering peritoneal fibrinolytic activity.
This study confirms the previous report that the amplitude of cerebral-evoked potentials on magnetic stimulation of paraspinal muscles is depressed in the presence of palpable muscle spasm. The close correlation among these potentials, paraspinal muscle spasm, and clinical symptoms suggests that the measurement of muscle activity may be more important in the assessment of low back pain than is commonly accepted.
In our cohort study, dopamine use was linked to mortality as compared to other vasopressor therapies, particularly in patients with essential hypertension. Future randomized studies attempting to compare dopamine with other therapies in septic shock should pay attention to patients with essential hypertension.
The data demonstrate a relative imbalance between bone formation and resorption associated with fragility fracture in elderly women with low vitamin D status. The authors suggest that compensatory elevation of serum OPG, particularly with reduced bone formation, is insufficient to limit bone loss leading to fracture.
Olfactory impairment (OI) in Parkinson disease (PD) may be unrelated to other impairment domains of the disease, which may indicate that olfaction is an independent feature of PD. Parkin and DJ-1 mutation carriers had normal identification scores but the number of mutation carriers is too small to draw conclusions. The APOE genotype (APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 alleles) and SNCA-REP1 polymorphism do not seem to influence olfaction in PD.
Treating superficial facial telangiectasia with a pulse stacking technique may improve clinical results without significantly increasing adverse effects.
In 1 out of 3 patients, younger than 65 years, suffering from CVI in whom nor medical history, nor TTE, nor Carotid Ultrasound could reveal the cause of the CVI our TEE-findings altered their management.
Features suggesting non-IgE-mediated CMPA appear common in infants with gastroschisis.
The majority of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reliably report their cigarette consumption.
Elevated cisternal CSF proteins may play an important role in determining visual outcome in large to giant VSs. Ventricular CSF analysis is often unable confirm the presence of VS-associated cisternal hyperproteinorrhachia. High CMCP levels may influence decision-making while instituting a permanent CSF diversion for postoperative hydrocephalus or recalcitrant pseudomeningocoele.
Senior house officers have a low expectation of the present system and seem willing to accept middle grade doctors as mentors.
IP derangement was a common finding in LC, especially in patients with more advanced disease (presence of ascites and history of SBP). The presence of (51)Cr-EDTA in ascites in patients with SBP suggests an altered permeability of splancnic vessels and/or peritoneal membranes. Further studies are required to assess (51)Cr-EDTA urine and ascite cutoffs to set up SBP preventive strategies.
(90)Y radioembolization induced frequent and similar increases in functional liver remnant volume compared with portal vein embolization. This technique should be tested in a prospective study phase 2 study before liver resection.
Breech presentation at delivery is a marker for the presence of congenital anomaly. Infants delivered breech deserve special scrutiny for the presence of malformation.
While some traditional CV risk factors imparted similar risk among RA compared with non-RA subjects, others (ie, male gender, smoking and personal cardiac history) imparted significantly less risk for the development of CV disease. These differences in the overall impact of traditional CV risk factors suggest that strategies to prevent CV disease and mortality focused solely on controlling traditional CV risk factors may be relatively less beneficial in RA subjects than in the general population. Further research is needed to determine optimal approaches to reducing CV morbidity and mortality in persons with RA.
Neutropenia<or = 2.5 x 10(9) while on azathioprine does not reduce the relapse rates of IBD patients who were established on azathioprine therapy compared with neutrophil counts>2.5 x 10(9).
The most serious cases of invasive pneumococcal infections in Malopolska region were caused by isolates of serotypes covered by 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. The results of this study prove the advantages of wide usage of the pneumococcal vaccine in the Polish population children.
More than 5% of the abdominal, thyroid, and carotid US scans requested by family physicians were not clearly indicated based on the clinical history provided. Common trends in requesting these examinations reinforce the need to improve guidelines for requesting scans and for managing many presenting complaints in family practice.
Bedside ultrasound is a useful tool to help the decision-making in urological emergencies and reasonably accurate in hands of a trainee urologist. It is especially helpful for excluding obstruction in presence of infection or renal failure. However it has inherent limitations in assessing acute ureteric colic.
Both early- and late-onset depression post-AMI were significantly associated with mortality up to eight years post-AMI. Depression is a strong independent predictor of post-AMI mortality in older adults.
This preliminary report suggests that there may be distinct temporal trajectories of neurocognitive improvement following remission in MDD. Aspects of neurocognitive functioning should be examined further as a means of providing a useful objective marker of treatment response.
Coated platelet levels were not associated with bleeding phenotype in this study; however, these data may suggest coated platelet levels are lower in haemophilia patients relative to healthy volunteers.
This population based study using life grid interviews for life course exposure assessment has addressed many deficiencies in the design of previous studies. The findings support those in most of the international literature of a modestly raised risk of lung cancer with prolonged residence close to heavy industry, although the confidence intervals were wide. The effect of air pollution on the incidence of lung cancer merits continued study.
Previous studies showed the intrinsic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to regulate choroid plexus blood flow and CSF production. Altered levels of angiotensinogen could indicate an imbalance of the RAS in IIH that may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.
This study demonstrates the specific effectiveness of IPT and medications in reducing suicidal ideation (relative to placebo), albeit largely as a consequence of their more general effects on depression. This adds to the growing body of evidence that depression treatments, specifically IPT and medication, can also reduce suicidal ideation and serves to further our understanding of the complex relationship between depression and suicide.
Patients with metabolic syndrome, with or without AGA, were significantly more insulin resistant compared with patients with AGA with no metabolic syndrome and with healthy subjects and, therefore, no true association exists between AGA and insulin resistance.
Allopurinol hypersensitivit y syndrome is a life-threatening cutaneous adverse reaction. Allopurinol should be initiated under clear indications with appropriate dosages. Potential associations with this syndrome include the Chinese race, the elderly, and patients with underlying renal impairment.
This study provides statistical evidence that one view is adequate and safe for the majority of hip fractures. The lateral radiograph should not be performed routinely in order to make considerable savings in money and time and to avoid unnecessary patient discomfort.
Almost two thirds of new Medicaid recipients lose coverage within 12 months. It is unlikely that Medicaid managed care will enhance continuity of care for new recipients.
The use of an expansion device for ACL reconstructions seemed to be a promising alternative to an interference screw. Insertion torque alone was not a useful predictor of graft fixation strength in ACL reconstructions.
A comparison of a randomized clinical trial of donepezil in AD patients and this observational study indicates that if appropriate methodological and statistical precautions are undertaken, then results from randomized clinical trials can be predictive with AD patients in clinical practice. This California study supports the modest effectiveness of donepezil in AD patients having clinical characteristics similar to those of the Nordic study.
Placement of CVC is safe in experienced hands. In monitored intensive care unit patients who undergo a "straightforward" procedure with<3 needle passes, chest radiograph can be safely deferred until the next scheduled examination.
Lack of data about the numbers of eligible men and women means that we cannot draw conclusions about self-selection biases among potential applicants. However, the selection procedures of the Committee appear to be unbiased. The gender of applicants does not influence the outcome of their application.
These results confirm both the safety and efficacy of the ROCsafeRX MPC for a large variety of cardiac patients. Minimized perfusion circuits should, therefore, play a greater role in daily practice so that as many patients as possible can benefit from their advantages.
First-trimester sonographic examinations are associated with a negligible rise in TI.
Using standardized scores, elderly patients on renal replacement therapy (haemodialysis and kidney transplant) had relatively better HRQOL than younger patients, and in the case of transplant patients, they had even better HRQOL than in the general population of the same age and gender.
The research hypotheses were partially confirmed. Positive social influencers appear to possess personality attributes conducive to relationship building, which is an important feature of effective leadership. The findings have implications for identifying and training potential leaders in medicine.
Lung preservation with LPD as compared with MEC does not improve early gas exchange or impact 90-day and 1-year mortality. Continued investigation into lung preservation solution composition is necessary to reduce the incidence of PGD.
Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas present frequently as mesoademonas and giant adenomas. Patients with these tumors may have subclinical visual or hormonal deficits at the time of diagnosis. Early and effective surgical treatment is essential for rapid recovery of visual and/or hormonal deficits, particularly in symptomatic cases.
We conclude that epidural use of ropivacaine 1 mg/ml+fentanyl 2 microg/ml provides effective analgesia with equal volume requirements irrespective of administration mode, with a high spontaneous delivery rate. Choice of PCEA or CEI (continuous epidural infusion) should be directed by other considerations, most importantly compliance of midwife and possible reduction in workload for anaesthesiology staff.
Long-term survival can be achieved in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
The results could lead to the conclusion that OTA could play an important role in proteinuria of patients with chronic renal diseases in Taiwan. And OTA may play a role in diabetes patients with nephropathy. Further longitudinal study is needed to clarify the role of OTA in diabetic nephropathy.
CLO patients with blood group O, RhD negative carry a disproportionately higher risk of developing OAC. The mechanism is unknown but the finding has practical application in guiding risk stratification and intensity of surveillance.
