To improve POM, esophageal and gastric cancer surgery should be centralized, irrespective of the patient's comorbidity or tumor location.
Primary anastomosis and protective ileostomy is a superior treatment to HP in acute left-sided colon perforation. In the absence of feculent peritonitis an ileostomy appears unnecessary.
In contrast to preeclampsia, uncomplicated mild to moderate chronic hypertensive pregnancies are characterized by an excess production of prostacyclin with unaltered or even lower thromboxane concentrations, which may contribute to the general favorable outcome of this hypertensive condition.
A simple prompt in the surgical admission document has significantly improved the documentation of pregnancy status and gynaecological history in our female patients, particularly in those who require surgical intervention. A number of patient safety concerns were addressed locally, but require a coordinated, interdisciplinary discussion and a national guideline. A minimum standard of care, in females of reproductive age, should include mandatory objective documentation of pregnancy status, whether or not they require surgical intervention.
A strain injury of the rectus femoris muscle, which is common in young athletic patients, may cause a concomitant tear of the acetabular labrum. Therefore, we recommend further diagnostic work-up in cases with prolonged hip pain and impaired hip function following an AIIS injury in order to identify any associated peri- and intra-articular damage. In our experience these patients seldom need aggressive surgical management.
The results suggest a greater equity in having a regular doctor on the basis of need. Systemic changes might be needed to enhance potential access among the vulnerable segment of the population.
Self-reported outcomes in older adults with conservatively managed wrist fractures were not related to the "acceptability" of radiographic fracture reduction. The proportion of acceptable reductions varied by 40% depending on which index was reported. Consequently, detailed reporting of these indices in older adults with distal radius fracture may be inefficient or perhaps even unnecessary.
HLA class I APM component abnormalities appear to represent an immune escape mechanism of RCC. This finding emphasizes the need to evaluate the integrity and expression of these molecules in patients with RCC, especially in those selected for treatment with T-cell based immunotherapy.
For most patients with a diagnosis of heart failure but preserved left ventricular systolic function there is an alternative explanation for their symptoms-for example, obesity, lung disease, and myocardial ischaemia-and the diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is rarely needed. These alternative diagnoses should be rigorously sought and managed accordingly.
The current results indicate a significant correlation of NT values in consecutive unaffected pregnancies. There also was a predisposition for a repeated isolated increased NT in subsequent pregnancies. Additional series and more information are needed before firm conclusions can be made.
Despite having a very low volume of thoracic surgical cases the community hospital had crude outcomes comparable to those reported from high volume tertiary hospitals. This suggests that the surgeon may be a more important factor in the hospital volume-outcome relationship than previously thought. Nevertheless, complex thoracic surgical operations are ideally performed by an experienced surgeon, and in a high volume hospital
This simple and inexpensive intervention, delivered as part of well-child care, changed parent attitudes toward the importance of reading with their infants and toddlers. These intervention parents and their children read more together and this was associated with enhanced language development in older toddlers in this diverse group of low-income families.
We believe this is the first study reporting a benefit in second-line setting for CRPC patients previously treated with docetaxel and poor PS.
Acitretin appears to be an effective treatment for refractory HS, leading to reduction of pain from painful nodules and reducing the extent of the disease for a prolonged period.
Our preliminary data indicate that the presence of HPIN on TRUS-guided biopsies is not a factor to delay an indicated surgical intervention for infravesical obstruction.
The results suggest that in young adults, smoking may be associated with a failure to take risks in situations where risk-taking is adaptive.
Overall, limited functional differences were found between the two groups in this small pilot study, so a superior surgical technique could not be determined; whereas our limited sample size prevents a firm conclusion of no difference, our data can be considered hypothesis-generating for future, larger studies. Although some evidence indicated that patients with a bone bridge have improved loading at higher speeds, a regression of all patients walking at self-selected speed indicates that as residual limb length increases, loading increases regardless of amputation type. Thus, our data suggest it is important to preserve residual limb length to allow for improved loading in terminal stance.
HRV and BRS measures in TBI patients during intensive care treatment, including sedative, analgesic, and vasoactive drugs, may identify patients with poor late neurological outcome.
Disability and perceived handicap levels are comparable in clinical hand OA patients with more symptomatic BT or IP. These two groups should not be considered different during trials assessing treatments for hand OA when the primary outcome measure assesses disability.
Perinatal testicular torsion occurs after descent but before fixation of the tunica vaginalis to the scrotal wall. These testes atrophy, leaving a remnant of tissue in the scrotum that can be identified on scrotal exploration in almost all cases. Therefore, it is recommended that the evaluation of the child with a solitary palpable testis start with scrotal exploration. Laparoscopy should be reserved for those in whom no tissue consistent with a testicular nubbin is found in the scrotum.
This study showed that the HU values on preoperative computed tomography did not suffice for the detection of cholesteatoma lesions. A clinician's physical examination together with an interpretation of computed tomography is still the "gold standard" method.
Before endorsing this protocol in routine application, inclusion/exclusion criteria must be asserted and additional clinical cases with longer follow-up are warranted. Nonetheless, this unconventional protocol opens intriguing possibilities; it also suggests that there is still room to further revisit some of the leading concepts in dental implantology.
Compared with laparotomy, laparoscopy offers equivalent efficacy for diagnosing and treating SBIs, and reduces postoperative complications as well as recovery period.
At presentation, GBS correctly identifies patients with variceal bleeding as high risk and appears superior to the admission Rockall score. However, GBS and both Rockall scores are poor at predicting clinical outcome within this group.
Herein, we have reported that, except for the patients with risk factors for venous thromboemboli, heparinization was not necessary in the early postoperative period and did not add benefits to outcomes of cadaveric renal transplant recipients.
SCC appears to be more aggressive than urothelial carcinoma after adjusting for stage and other prognostic factors, except for cases in which the tumor was confined to the bladder wall and the bladder was removed as a part of the initial treatment.
Despite the fact that statistically significant differences in average COHb measurements were seen with regard to a number of variables, the clinical significance of these differences appeared to be minimal. Moreover, the utility of COHb measurements as predictors of clinical status in CO poisoning was not apparent. At least in part, this likely relates to delay and interval oxygen administration before obtaining COHb measurements.
We found interesting differences in clinical and organisational performance between GPs with and without medical experience in developing countries and between their practices. It is not possible to attribute these differences to this experience, because the choice for medical experience in a tropical country probably reflects individual differences in professional motivation and personality. Experience in a developing country may be just as valuable for later performance in general practice as experience at home.
The findings suggest that laparoscopic appendectomy should be avoided in children who have complicated appendicitis because of the increased risk for postoperative intraabdominal abscesses. The authors propose a prospective, randomized trial to verify this finding.
The Single Fraction HDR protocol results in high disease control rate and low toxicity similar to our previous protocol using two HDR insertions, with significant savings in resources. While mature results with longer follow-up are awaited, a single 15 Gy may be considered as a standard fractionation regimen in combination with EBRT for men with intermediate risk disease.
Our results suggest that no advantage is gained by preoperative MBP in elective colorectal surgery.
GSV stripping modestly improves arterial leg blood flow at the onset of exercise in patients with GSV insufficiency, because of an improved effect of the leg muscle pump.
The rate of SSI following fusion or spinal laminectomy/laminoplasty was higher during the summer in this network of community hospitals. The increase appears to be related to increases in SSIs caused by gram-positive cocci and, more specifically, S. aureus. Given the nonteaching nature of these hospitals, the findings demonstrate that increases in the rate of SSI during the summer are more likely related to ecological and/or environmental factors than the July effect.
Our findings indicate that caution is needed in the selection and application of available data to estimate trends in macronutrient intake by the US population and in the interpretation of these data with regard to public health research, policies, and programs.
These findings are consistent with other reports in the literature that the morbid risk of OCD is elevated in relatives of probands with early-onset OCD. However, the majority of cases do not have a positive family history of OCD. This result suggests that early onset is not the only specific clinical marker for familial risk in OCD. Thus more work is needed to clearly elucidate other factors related to increased genetic vulnerability for OCD.
IBA is highly reproducible for detecting sperm antibodies in both fresh and cryopreserved/thawed samples of human spermatozoa.
We suggest that application of topical lidocaine with adrenaline seems to be a safe and easy medication for local anesthetic use. However, in our study, lidocaine with adrenaline offered no advantage over placebo in the control of post-operative pain and other morbidity related factors following pediatric tonsillectomy. We therefore do not recommend topical application of lidocaine with adrenaline for reducing morbidity in pediatric tonsil surgery.
In some situations, it is preferable to use concentrations with values below the LOQ to evaluate the results of pharmacokinetic studies. However, this should not be the rule, especially when this does not bring any additional information, or when it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the bioanalytical assay.
Rotavirus infection was associated with increased distal ileum wall thickness and lymphadenopathy during the illness period. These changes suggest a plausible mechanism by which rotavirus infection could cause intussusception.
Reconstruction algorithm-dependent variability in PERCIST classification is a significant issue but can be overcome by harmonizing SULs using a proprietary software tool.
The results show that parents influence on children's physical activity in a variety of ways. Parents influence their children's physical activity in direct and indirect manners through their encouragement, involvement and modelling. Furthermore, mother and father influence their children's physical activity in different ways. This versatility should be taken into consideration in future interventions.
We consider the Tono-Pen to be an alternative to Schiøtz tonometry. The maximum mean difference between the methods for one GP, 1.9 mmHg, was within clinically acceptable limits. Possible reasons for the different agreement for the two observers are discussed.
Topographical location and severity of cartilage damage of the patella can significantly influence function after successful Oxford medial UKA. Surgeons should factor this in when making their operative decision, and undertake to counsel patients appropriately. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B(10 Suppl B):11-15.
Surgical correction of leaflet prolapse in combination with proximal aortic replacement is feasible with good results. Midterm results are identical with those known for morphologically normal leaflets. Repair of prolapse allows for preservation of the native valve in most patients with aortic regurgitation and aortic pathology, and thus appears a beneficial addition to valve-preserving surgery.
A comprehensive harm reduction model delivered through peer-led and community-based strategies reduced HIV risk among PWID in China. Both DiC activities and outreach were effective in providing PWID behavior change communications (BCC) and HTC. HTC is best offered in settings like DiCs, where there is privacy for testing and receiving results. Outreach coverage was low, especially in Guangxi province where the implementation model required building the technical capacity of government partners and grassroot organizations. Outreach appears to be most effective for referring PWID into HTC, especially when DiC-based HTC is not available and increasing awareness of DiCs where PWID can receive more intensive BCC interventions.
These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion as to whether or not, and to what extent, quality improvement interventions work equally well across income groups or require tailoring for specific vulnerable populations.
Overall, for malaria care the uninsured are more likely to choose informal care compared to the insured for the treatment of malaria.
Combined proximal descending aortic endografting plus distal bare metal stenting for aortic dissection provides favorable short-term outcomes and decreases late distal aortic complications compared with conventional endovascular repair. These results support a more widespread application of this approach. A prospective, randomized trial is needed before definite conclusions can be made.
Although the depth of tumor invasion can be correctly assessed intraoperatively, it is difficult to be precise regarding the presence of nodal metastases. One practical solution to this problem might be to employ limited surgery for those patients with macroscopically elevated and histologically differentiated tumors.
The DGP/tTG Screen assay could be considered as the best initial test for CD. Combinations of two tests, including a DGP/tTG Screen, might be able to diagnose CD accurately in different clinical scenarios making biopsy avoidable in a high proportion of subjects.
Sensitivity of PEF monitoring using the ABC score for the diagnosis of occupational asthma can be improved by having a longer period off work.
Performance-based cognitive measures are predictive of future at-fault MVCs in older adults. Cognitive performance, in particular, is a salient predictor of subsequent crash involvement in older adults. High-risk older drivers can be identified through brief, performance-based measures administered in a MVA setting.
The time of hospitalization is a potential "golden opportunity" to counsel patients and promote colon cancer screening.
Serious errors are unlikely, but the revised criteria may be less reproducible as they include more diagnostic categories. Revisions of diagnostic criteria should be tested for reproducibility and validity prior to widespread adoption.
Most of the women who had had an induced abortion with reported complications did, however, carry a subsequent pregnancy to term with no more complications than other women of similar parity and age.
The results of this study suggest that the development of agoraphobia in panic disorder is influenced by specific variables and is not a purely coincidental process.
Our review revealed low cancer literacy of breast cancer risk factors among Indian women, irrespective of their socio-economic and educational background. There is an urgent need for nation- and state-wide awareness programmes, engaging multiple stakeholders of society and the health system, to help improve cancer literacy in India.
The new CKiD equation predicts GFR in paediatric oncology patients with more accuracy than creatinine-based equations. When the estimated GFR is>100 ml/min/1.73 m(2) , isotopic GFR can be safely omitted.
webPOISONCONTROL augments traditional poison control services by providing automated, accurate online access to case-specific triage and first aid guidance for poison ingestions. It is safe, quick, and easy to use.
Counselling for risk diseases such as increased cholesterol is more frequently provided than basic lifestyle counselling. We found some doctors and practice factors associated with counselling behaviour, but the majority has to be explained by further studies.
Failure of fixation with recurrent widening of the pubic space can be expected after plating of the pubic symphysis for traumatic diastasis. Although widening may represent a benign condition as motion is restored to the pubic symphysis, patients should be counseled regarding a high risk of radiographic failure but a small likelihood of revision surgery.
Given the challenges associated with diagnosing Lyme borreliosis, the selected notification criteria should be closely linked with the purpose of the surveillance system. Restricting reportable Lyme borreliosis to neuroborreliosis may increase validity, while a more sensitive case definition (potentially including erythema migrans) may better reflect the true burden of disease. We recommend revising the current notification criteria in Norway to ensure that they are unambiguous for clinicians and laboratories.
In patients with normal resting ECGs, we conclude the following: (1) a history of hypertension is not a cause of a false-positive exercise test, and (2) higher exercise systolic BP is a significant but weak predictor of ST-segment depression.
Circumcision must not be considered a mandatory time in Nesbit procedure: on the contrary, mandatory is the respect of the anatomical structures surgically attacked to avoid preputial resection.
Preoperative radiotherapy, rather than postoperative radiotherapy, may improve local control of stage IV rectal cancer. However, chemoradiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with stage IV rectal cancer in this study.
Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation frequently induces inhibition of the PM function already at the clinically set ventricular sensitivity. Therefore, individual testing is warranted before TENS treatment is considered in patients with a PM. A test protocol for TENS and PM interaction is proposed.
We speculate that the effects of prostate brachytherapy on spermatogenesis in prostate cancer patients are minimal. However, due to the half-life of I, we recommend that these patients should wait for at least 3-4 months before trying to conceive. Furthermore, younger men with prostate cancer may want to consider sperm banking prior to brachytherapy if they want to have children in the future.
Few Chinese Western medicine CPGs recommend TCM therapies and very few provide evidence grading for the TCM recommendation. We suggest that future guideline development should be based on systematic searches for evidence to support CPG recommendations and involve a multidisciplinary approach including TCM expertise.
Patients with AS do equally well with surgical commissurotomy or balloon valvuloplasty as initial palliation. This holds true for those with either critical or noncritical aortic stenosis. Valve morphology did not help in selection of initial palliative strategy. Current technologies should enable an improved selection of initial palliative approach through thoughtful, randomized trials.
When following a policy of wage increases, attention to the issues of working time-including overtime hours, working part-time, and commuting time-and wage satisfaction are suitable strategies in managing health workforce retention.
The quantitative and qualitative findings of this pilot study suggest that MAP participation was associated with a number of positive outcomes including fewer hospital admissions, detox episodes, and police contacts leading to custody, reduced NBA consumption, and decreases in some alcohol-related harms. These encouraging trends are being investigated in a larger national study.
Lifting of postoperative restrictions after limited discectomy allowed shortened sick leave without increased complications. Postoperative precautions in these patients may not be necessary.
Relative inequalities in smoking prevalence depend on the survey used. Our results suggest that the NHIS and the ECHP are more reliable sources of information on educational inequalities in smoking than the EB.
The present study, which examined and compared different age groups of gymnasts, showed that young rhythmic gymnasts who trained intensively, had a delayed onset of menarche of more than two years, thus favouring secondary amenorrhea. Nonetheless, almost all athletes, even though with significant delay, reached cycle regularity, thus minimizing the effect of menstrual disorders on fertility and bone density.
Neonatal outcomes for Aboriginal infants were better than expected from national and State reports. Outcomes for Torres Strait Islander infants were worse than expected. Ethnicity was not a risk factor for neonatal death. These findings suggest that outcomes may be further improved by programmes to increase access for Indigenous women to antenatal care services.
This study showed no specific clinical, bacteriological or radiological features between age groups, and does not support the hypothesis of any age-related patterns in pulmonary tuberculosis.
For small, intracranial AVMs distortion correction did not significantly reduce the errors associated with the definition of the stereotactic co-ordinates. We suggest that prior to the purchase of this software, similar in-house testing should be performed.
Ghrelin and PP fall transiently after surgery, possibly due to vagal dysfunction, and ultimately, as weight loss ensues, ghrelin secretion increases to higher than preoperative levels. The RYBGP procedure affects the gastric mucosa, as reflected by a transient increase in circulating PGI, and subsequently, the mucosa in the excluded stomach is at rest, as shown by low levels of PGI and gastrin.
Redesign efforts in healthcare, so it seems, do not influence organizational climate as much as expected.
Surgical staging achieved excellent survival for stage I endometrial cancer patients without incurring untoward morbidity and mortality. No survival advantage of adjuvant radiotherapy was detected even for high-risk patients, so we suggest the use of radiotherapy may be reserved for relapse.
There is no damage to the gluteus medius tendon with the use of the modified medial trochanteric portal. Although the clinical implications of this finding are not known with certainty, the use of the modified medial trochanteric entry portal for antegrade femoral nailing could possibly result in less postoperative morbidity because it does not damage the gluteus medius tendon as compared to the traditional more lateral trochanteric portal.
VUE images are feasible for pancreatic abdominal CT. A combined DE/SE dual-phase protocol permits a significant reduction in dose exposure to patients.
MRI could be a useful method to evaluate quality of repair of CC ligaments. The minimally invasive surgical techniques used in this study showed similar radiological and clinical efficacy in the treatment of acute Rockwood type III AC dislocation, but AC TightRope fixation provided patients with significantly more treatment satisfaction and less inconvenience than Bosworth screw fixation.
High-signal-intensity changes after radiosurgery for brain AVMs, far beyond the 10-Gy isodose area on T2-weighted images, are especially seen in brain AVMs draining through a single vein. The higher occlusion rate of brain AVMs under these circumstances is well appreciated.
Incorporating a second annotator into a PII annotation process reduces unredacted PII and improves the quality of annotations to 0.99 recall, yielding clear benefit at reasonable cost; the cost advantages of annotation teams larger than two diminish rapidly.
The use of the TT is difficult and the skills acquired by the medical students deteriorate significantly over time. The LMA and the ETC seem to have an advantage over the TT in that they are more easily learnt and the skills better retained. It is recommended that these alternative devices be included in the medical school curriculum for airway management.
When considered alone, measures of HV are not good markers to differentiate AD from bvFTD. Hippocampal sclerosis associated with FTD may explain the high degree of overlap in nHV between both groups.
Pancreatoscopy is of diagnostic value in addition to CT, transabdominal ultrasound and ERCP in the differential diagnosis of poorly defined pancreatic lesions, particularly when assessing alterations of the ductal caliber without parenchymatous lesions.
The PAB technique is not optimal for treatment of AX lymph nodes in an SCV field. We conclude that CT treatment planning with dose optimization around delineated target volumes should become standard for radiation treatments of supraclavicular and AX lymph nodes.
Elderly-unfit patients with comorbidities and>70 years of age can be submitted to radical pelvic irradiation. The results observed in this retrospective analysis have encouraged us to use non-palliative radiotherapy doses in these patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
These findings suggest that childhood sexual abuse may lead to decreased probability of screening for cervical cancer, potentially contributing to the poorer health seen in other studies of women who have been sexually abused.
Exposure of human fetal testes to DBP is unlikely to impair testosterone production as it does in rats. This has important safety and regulatory implications.
Presented data propose that advanced age is correlated with a higher mortality, but not with prolonged ICU treatment or higher costs after cardiac surgery. Considering the encouraging functional status and QOL of the survivors, the financial burden caused by octogenarians is justified.
A large proportion of those patients thought initially to be less severely injured required resources available in a trauma centre, including specialty care, intensive care, and operating room accessibility. Over one-third of these patients had multisystem injuries and almost 20% were considered major trauma, needing prioritisation of care and expertise ideally found in a trauma centre environment. Complications developed in a sizable number of patients. This patient population, because of its heterogeneity and propensity for critical illness, deserves the resources of a trauma centre.
These observations underscore the importance of the quality and not merely the quantity of intimal proliferation in determining occurrence of morbid cardiac events and further emphasize the interaction of immunologic and non-immunologic factors in determining event vulnerability in cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
While endarterectomy is the procedure of choice in carotid bifurcation stenosis, internal carotid artery bypass can be performed with reasonable outcomes whenever necessary. Prosthetic reconstruction of the internal carotid artery had acceptable results that was comparable to vein graft reconstruction.
Thyroidectomy in patients with coagulopathy is feasible with low risk of bleeding if meticulous hemostasis, particularly using ligasure vessel sealing system, is respected.
The diagnosis of FIGO stage I ovarian cancer can be made with confidence if laparoscopic inspection of certain areas reveals no evidence of metastases.
The phenotypic association between MD and FTND is likely due to both a causal relationship, wherein increasing levels of nicotine dependence increase one's risk for depression, and to a shared genetic liability between the two.
Mean aesthetic scores were higher in the ADM-assisted breast reconstruction cohort including the total aesthetic score which was statistically significant. Aesthetic outcome alone may justify the added expense of incorporating biologic mesh. Moreover, ADM has other benefits which may render it cost-effective. Larger prospective studies are needed to provide plastic surgeons with more definitive guidelines for ADM use.
The diagnostic value of MRU appears to be superior to that of other imaging tests, even to that of DMSA scintigraphy, which with voiding cystourethrography is currently considered the gold standard for evaluating sonographically suspected solitary kidneys with contralateral orthotopic or ectopic renal buds and ectopic ureteral insertion.
MDD thus appeared to be a confounding variable in the relationship between alcohol use and AUD, and self-reported measures of AUD seemed to be overestimated by depressive people. This result brings into question the accuracy of self-reported measures of substance use disorders. Furthermore, it adds to the emerging debate about the usefulness of substance use disorder as a concept, when heavy substance use itself appears to be a sensitive and reliable indicator.
There may be a very high incidence of nonbladder surgeries just before IC/BPS onset that decreases to historical levels over the first years of the syndrome.
Medical patients from both age groups had significant psychological distress symptoms scores. Younger patients with chronic medical illnesses were more vulnerable to severe psychological distress, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, hostility and somatization. Therefore, clinicians should direct efforts to recognize these symptoms in order to prevent further functional impairment.
We found limited alterations of several OS parameters, which do not characterize either systemic or cellular high-grade OS during elective AAAR.
Antibiotic therapy effectively reduced the subsequent occurrence of positive urine cultures, but symptoms were not reduced. Based on this study of morbidity, previous studies failing to show any relation to mortality, and the cost and complications of antibiotic therapy in the older population, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women is contraindicated.
Short- and intermediate-term morbidity and mortality were greater in patients undergoing a biventricular repair than in a similar group of patients undergoing total cavopulmonary connection. It is unknown whether the long-term results of a total cavopulmonary connection in patients with two ventricles are as good as those obtained with a biventricular approach. However, there may be situations in which the short- and intermediate-term risks of a complex biventricular repair may outweigh the long-term disadvantages of a single ventricle approach.
Calculated gastric mucosal pH is not an early predictor of survival in cardiac surgery patients with postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. Further studies are required to assess whether the gradient between arterial and intramucosal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) might be a more useful predictive value.
Thus, the MGZL may be a wider category than we think and hence the use of a wide immunopanel is recommended to identify the aggressively behaving mediastinal B-cell lymphomas.
Local excision, when combined with selective chemoradiation therapy, can be safely applied to patients with large (>3 cm) and more advanced T3 and N1 rectal carcinomas.
This article suggests that a crucial element in any step-increase of research capability will be the adoption of adaptive governance models. These must recognise a range of approaches to delivering safe and effective data linkage, while remaining responsive to public and research user expectations and needs as these shift and change with time and experience. The targets are multiple and constantly moving. There is not--nor should we seek--a single magic bullet in delivering good governance in health research.
The psychiatry clerkship does not change students' view on the attitude assessed in this study, regardless of their origin (Israeli or U.S.). Further research is needed in order to find more clerkship-dependent contributors to positive or negative attitudes toward psychiatry.
Patients with three copies of the CYP2D6 gene, a genotype consistent with ultrarapid metabolism, or both have an increased incidence of ondansetron failure for the prevention of postoperative vomiting but not nausea.
Clinicians should consider the prognostic importance of LVH when assessing risk in patients with CAD. Because LVH is more common among black and women patients with CAD, it partially accounts for racial and gender differences in survival.
It can be concluded that country has a significant influence on lost productivity among patients with rheumatic disorders, when corrected for other variables that have an influence on absenteeism and presenteeism. Transferring lost productivity data across countries without adaptation is hindered by the significant differences between countries in this patient group. As a result, transferring lost productivity data, being either monetary values or volumes of productivity losses, between countries can give wrong estimations of the cost effectiveness of treatments.
It is incumbent upon the Gaelic Athletic Association to expand current safety regulations to eliminate injuries in these key areas. This should include mandatory checks of faceguards by match officials prior to the commencement of matches. Finally, there needs to be more robust data collection by the association to ascertain the true extent of long-term ocular morbidity following these types of injuries.
Paracetamol demonstrates an arteriovenous difference in concentration, and the use of finger-prick samples may give rise to results which differ from those obtained with traditional venous sampling especially during the first 1 h following drug ingestion.
Both IGF-I and IGFBP-1 appear to correlate well with markers of protein-energy malnutrition and sarcopenia. However, IGF-I is also influenced by age, whereas IGFBP-1 is influenced by glucose metabolism. IGFBP-3 does not correlate with nutritional status in ESRD, perhaps because of a strong association with inflammation.
Combined insulin-sulfonylurea therapy leads to modest improvement in glycemic control compared with insulin therapy alone. With combined therapy, lower insulin doses may be used to achieve similar control. Obese patients with higher fasting C-peptides may be more likely to respond than others.
The results of the study demonstrated that there were no significant changes in DPOAE values with the cessation of cortisol secretion, while there was a progressive increase in ABR thresholds, which could be overcome with cortisone replacement.
Our results demonstrate that the already established approaches for chemical permeation enhancement of drug molecules and their postulated mechanisms could be used as preliminary guidelines for enhancing the penetration of nanoparticles. At this size range of 15 nm, intercellular lipids provide the main barrier to particle penetration through the stratum corneum.
Values for health states when ascribed to adults are higher than when those same states are associated with children. Were EQ-5D-3L values for adults applied to EQ-5D-Y health states, then this would effectively lead to an misrepresentation of the value assigned to a health status in children.
All three treatments were effective at changing different dimensions of quality of life, but the combined treatment showed the most change. The results support the effectiveness of treatments applied to the suboccipital region for patients with TTH.
A paper-based instrument can capture data indistinguishable from data captured from an electronic product. Processes to collect diary data should be evaluated for each study rather than simply to use the "latest" technology. Another interpretation is that frequency of recording diary data does not have a significant impact on outcomes.
The prevalence of steatosis was not higher in patients with CHB. HS is associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis, but not viral liver disease.
ICG usage during macular hole surgery was not associated with worse visual outcomes, suggesting possible toxic effects reported are not clinically significant. If the ILM cannot be peeled effectively, ICG should be considered a safe option.
Examination using the SCAN questionnaire cannot be used as prognosis of the length of stay either in day hospital or in stationary wards. Duration of hospitalization depends mainly on the diagnostic category (anxiety and affective disorders are associated with shorter hospital stays than psychotic disorders) irrespective of the number of diagnoses a patient received. It also depends on local therapeutic traditions and preferences (dominance of long-term care and the rehabilitation model of treatment instead of active acute intervention aiming at quick discharge from the hospital).
Our study shows that, despite of its high degree of domesticity, T. infestans has sylvatic colonies with normal chromatic characters (not melanic morphs) highly connected to D/PD conspecifics in the Argentinean Chaco. Sylvatic habitats may provide a transient or permanent refuge after control interventions, and function as sources for D/PD reinfestation. The occurrence of sylvatic foci of T. infestans in the Gran Chaco may pose additional threats to ongoing vector elimination efforts.
Clomiphene citrate stair-step protocol can be offered to PCOS CC-resistant patients as an alternative to gonadotrophin therapy with similar efficacy.
Carbohydrate structures on PRBC are different from those on PAEC. Healthy human sera contain anti-nonGal IgG antibodies to NeuGc expressed on PRBC, but not on PAEC. We speculate that anti-nonGal IgG antibodies to PRBC can recognize both NeuGc and protein, and this may be the reason why such antibodies have not been detected by ELISA. A definite conclusion about the immunogenicity of NeuGc has not been obtained. More sera from patients (not from non-human primates) sensitized with porcine cells or organs need to be studied.
Brief screening measures for depression are important clinical tools for terminally ill patients. For diagnostic purposes, however, they do not approach the validity of a single-item interview that asks, in effect, "Are you depressed?"
Both psychological and clinical risk factors are poorly correlated with concurrent measurements of CAC. Given our findings and previously established associations of these risk factors to cardiac events, further assessment of the relationship between chronicity of these risk factors and coronary atherosclerosis could be of interest. Our findings cast doubt on the use of CAC scanning as a surrogate means for assessing the clinical significance of both concurrently measured psychological and clinical risk factors.
Our results suggest that, although EBV is present in some of the squamous cell laryngeal carcinomas, its presence has no effect on the pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinomas.
Awareness of CKD is not associated with more optimal BP control, ACEI/ARB use or glycemic control. Future efforts in this area should further explore the measurement of CKD awareness and behaviors associated with CKD awareness.
Among sexually active adolescents, there was a statistically significant relationship between rates of Pap tests following the clinical practice meeting (χ(2) (1) = 13.5, p = .001). Prior to the meeting there were 29 Pap tests recorded, whereas after there were two Pap tests done. After the focused clinical practice meeting, providers performed far fewer Pap tests, which is in accordance with the guidelines for this population.
UroLift(®) implants allowed symptomatic improvement in more than 80% of the patients after 1-year follow-up. A high prostate volume may potentially be predictive of symptomatic failure.
Our work demonstrates that routine preoperative data can approximate frailty and predict geriatric-specific surgical risk. The models' predicative powers were comparable with that of established prospective frailty scores. Our calculator could be used as a low-cost simple screen for high-risk individuals who might require additional evaluation or specialized services.
The additional information in GP reports does not affect the conclusion regarding fitness for training in most cases and does not provide sufficient information to merit it being sought routinely.
The social gradient in diet quality may be explained by diet cost. Strategies to improve diet quality among lower socioeconomic strata may need to take food prices and diet cost along with nutrition education into account.
The gymnasts showed significant longitudinal UV changes toward less negative UV over the training period. Nevertheless, we could not find a significant correlation between UV and the majority of the researched variables. Thus, although UV has been broadly studied, this phenomenon is complex because it depends on different intrinsic and extrinsic factors that are difficult to control, making necessary additional research on this topic.
The similar morphologic characteristics of nonreactive gastrointestinal amyloid deposits, which we have designated "portal amyloid," suggest a common origin. Determination of whether portal amyloid represents a new type of amyloid will require chemical analysis.
The results from this exploratory study challenge the notion that individuals have preexisting health state preferences and call for further detailed research in this area. Furthermore, it raises concerns over current practices around preference elicitation exercises, which have tended to be carried out as a solitary exercise without allowing time for respondents to reflect and deliberate on their decisions.
ECG monitoring during kangaroo care should cause error because of superimposed electric activity from the parent. Oxygen saturation represents a more reliable method of monitoring during kangaroo care.
Our results suggest that serial testing with TGA and AEA might allow, in some cases, the avoidance of intestinal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of CD.
Costs estimates of a chronic disease vary considerably depending on the statistical method employed; therefore a careful choice of methods to analyze data is required before inferring results.
Clinicians appear to be implementing the recommendations of randomised controlled trials to offer induction after 41 weeks of gestation. However the trend of performing elective caesarean sections at earlier gestational ages may be unnecessarily putting some infants at increased risk of respiratory morbidity.
Stronger efforts are needed by transplant coordinators, physicians, and nurses to improve the education and knowledge of patients and their families about the basic aspects of transplantation. Greater public awareness may increase the willingness to donate organs.
The PDA devices were simple and convenient to use, while allowing for easy transfer and tabulation of database information by electronic mail. Significant gaps in BCS exposure were noted across the curriculum. Mentor sign-off on the PDA permitted early feedback opportunities. We can now begin to reward educators for skills mentoring and perform formal assessment of BCS within specific clerkships to enhance future educational objectives.
In this apparently clinically healthy population of abstinent alcohol-dependent subjects, frontal lobe dysfunction was detectable using the Trail A + B and digit symbol tasks. This was despite above-average WAIS-R IQ scores. Consideration needs to be given to routine incorporation of cognitive testing in alcohol dependence since subtle deficits may not be easily apparent and may impact on treatment outcome.
We suspect that PP may have a proclivity in the Iranian population.
Any pattern of Alcoholics Anonymous attendance, even if it declines or is never high for a particular 12-month period, is better than little or no attendance in terms of abstinence. Greater initial attendance carries added value. There is a benefit for maintaining a sponsor over time above that found for attendance.
The rheumatoid arthritis patients with both painless and painful synovitis exhibited similar disease histories and radiographic and ultrasound findings. However, the ultrasonography evaluation revealed worse scores in the second and fifth metacarpophalangeal of the synovitis patients who did not experience pain.
Strontium ranelate may be a new alternative in the treatment of pregnancy- and lactation-associated osteoporosis.
Our results support a comprehensive approach of care and argue in favour of care reorganization following the patient-centred model. To promote organizational care reforms through the prism of the doctor-patient relationship could thus be a fruitful way to insure a better quality of care and the social acceptability of the reforms.
The implementation of the FTC in GCA care appears to significantly reduce the risk of permanent visual impairment and is more cost effective by reducing the need for inpatient care.
There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in serum biochemical markers, nuchal translucency means and screen positive rates during the first trimester screening.
Night-time frequency appeared to be associated with GHQL mainly by affecting sleep conditions, a symptom that independently influenced some aspects of GHQL.
Increasing ETV dose from 0.5 mg to 1 mg after 1 year of ETV treatment may provide an effective suppression of viral replication.
Decisions based on surveillance data that are suggestive but not conclusive about the existence of a disease outbreak can be modeled.
In this study, very old patients had higher chances of mortality and a very low probability of achieving functional independence even after MMRT. Further prospective studies are needed to examine the futility of MMRT in the very old.
Overall, there have been no significant changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in Portuguese adolescents from 2002 to 2010. However, the prevalence remains high and therefore it is important to continue surveillance.
Spirituality and dimension harm avoidance are significant predictors of recovery from depression during a year long follow up.
The VCS clip failed to suppress intimal thickness or reduce the percentage of stenosis at the anastomotic site.
Motoneurons are still responsive to additional afferent inputs from various sources when rate modulation from voluntary drive is limited by SCI. Individuals with SCI may be able to combine inputs to control functional tasks they cannot perform with voluntary drive alone.
Relaparoscopy is an effective procedure in the management of minor bile leakage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and can be an alternative approach in selected situations.
Substantial gender functional differences exist before treatment. However, women reported greater improvement as a result of the intervention when compared with men.
HIV sero-status was not found to be an independent risk factor for complications of surgery. The most important risk factor for complication of surgery in HIV-infected patients is ASA risk class.
Based on our findings, it does not seem necessary to perform antrostomy at the inferior meatus, provided the patient has a patent osteomeatal complex and no anatomic abnormalities.
The good correlation between the two scales shows that the ABC scale is also reliable for premature babies.
It appears that ragging plays an important role in the genesis of depressive symptoms in medical students.
Patients who underwent chemoembolization for HCC showed a response (with both EASL criteria and mRECIST) and improved survival after the second chemoembolization treatment. At least two chemoembolization procedures should be performed in the same targeted lesions before further treatment is abandoned.
This study suggests that for Latinos, preferred language may be more important than ethnicity in mental health service use. Future studies comparing mental health use may need to differentiate between Spanish- and English-speaking Latinos.
The impact of the NIHSS on RSMRs was limited. The small number of stroke admissions and the narrow range of 30-day stroke mortality rates at the facility level in the Veterans Health Administration cast doubt on the value of using 30-day RSMRs as a means of identifying outlier hospitals based on their stroke care quality.
In obese patients undergoing gastric banding or gastric bypass, rocuronium dosed according to IBW provided a shorter duration of action without a significantly prolonged onset time or compromised conditions for tracheal intubation.
The addition of MII to the standard pH probe resulted in a change in management in approximately 25% of the patients, suggesting that there may be a role for pH-MII in clinical practice.
Higher preoperative thyroid volume, histopathologic characteristics of nodules, and multinodular disease are associated with an increased risk of recurrence in patients with unilateral nodular goiter. Unilateral lobectomy is an effective therapeutic option with low reoperation rates in unilateral benign thyroid disease.
Of all investigated techniques, Veo shows to be most promising, with a significant improvement of both the clinical and physical-technical image quality without adversely affecting contrast detail. MARs reconstruction in CT images of the oral cavity to reduce dental hardware metallic artifacts is not sufficient and may even adversely influence the image quality.
The effect of adverse weather conditions on road traffic injuries differed depending on the temperature. More road traffic injuries were related to rain precipitation when the temperature was moderate and to snow when it was below freezing.
Despite increased access to tPA in the hospital, we found that hospitalization is not cost-effective compared to same-day clinic evaluation following TIA. A very small fraction of patients benefits from hospitalization if urgent-access TIA clinics are available. The widespread development of urgent-access TIA clinics is warranted.
The disposition of primaquine was comparable between genders, suggesting no need to modify the dose of primaquine for malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Food increased the oral bioavailability of primaquine, which may lead to higher antimalarial efficacy. Grapefruit juice increased the bioavailability of primaquine, with marked interindividual differences suggesting that people should not take primaquine with grapefruit juice.
Though age, health and hysterectomy status appear to influence Pap test use, current national data suggest that there still may be overutilization and inappropriate screening of older women.
With similar expert knowledge, treatment decisions were made irrespective of sex. While the majority of male care providers performed complex therapies themselves, female clinicians referred more patients to specialists.
While these databases have been commonly used for orthopaedic trauma research, differences in the populations they represent are not always readily apparent. Care must be taken to understand fully these differences before performing or evaluating database research, as the outcomes they detail can only be analysed in context.
SANS is a painful spontaneously resolving necrosis of the palatal salivary glands, easily misdiagnosed preoperatively. The main differences from NS are smaller size of lesion, scarcity of ulceration, and absence of squamous metaplasia. Although initially described as a new autonomous entity, SANS might be an early or minimal form of NS.
Non-contrast spiral CT in patients with acute renal colic is an effective diagnostic tool which allows rapid and accurate evaluation of the urinary tract, thereby facilitating the acute management of patients with renal colic.
Malocclusion plays an important role in the oral health-related quality of life. However, the relationship between emotional well-being, social well-being and malocclusions was not as strong as in previous studies.
The finding of isolated echogenic foci at the time of the 20 week-scan does not significantly change the risks of trisomy 21 if background risk and previous nuchal translucency measurements are taken into account in the individual risk calculation. We suggest that no further adjustments to risk should be used.
In a double-injury rat model, NIH can be inhibited by short-term systemic rapamycin, but suppression of early cell migration and proliferation is pivotal. A limited peri-interventional antiproliferative therapy may be of value as an adjunct to control restenosis after balloon angioplasty and/or stenting.
Senior school going children are not ready to donate blood. Lack of knowledge and prevailing misconceptions regarding blood transfusions need to be addressed and mechanisms to motivate and mobilize youth for becoming voluntary blood donors need to be established.
No strong support was found overall for U-shaped relationships. However, no further general decrease in risk was seen among those with 3 h or more of hard physical activity per week. The contrasts observed between female educational groups may reflect different preferences regarding specific strenuous activities. Men aged 50 years or more seem in particular to benefit from hard physical activities.
Wearing a functional knee brace facilitated hamstring muscle reflex, but muscle fatigue lengthened the hamstring reflex latency. Subjects with ACL deficiency should not rely on the knee brace to facilitate hamstring reflex for joint protection during prolonged sporting activities when muscles are fatigued.
Associations between self-reported working conditions and health might be underestimated among women reporting an active job situation. Our findings contribute to the discussion on why the results in some studies show that active jobs among women are as hazardous for health as high-strain jobs.
Collected data confirm the high level of patients' satisfaction with the family medicine units of primary health care. Elaborated EUROPEP questionnaire seems to be a useful tool for the study Key words: satisfaction, health care quality, EUROPEP questionnaire.
Although the observed differences in morphologic characteristics between twins necessarily reflect nongenetic influences, the cortical patterns and midline structures of monozygotic twins probably are genetically similar.
We conclude that losing the ring-fenced ward and admitting elective arthroplasty patients to general wards results in longer length of stay and a financial loss of 6.82 % per hip and knee arthroplasty patient.
Compliance with the recommendations of the QUOROM statement is not universal in systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Flow diagrams make the conduct of study selection transparent only if the relationship between citations and studies is clearly expressed. Reviewers should understand what they are counting: citations, papers, studies and trials are fundamentally different concepts which should not be confused in a diagram.
This study demonstrates that increased detrusor pressure observed during voiding subsequent to detrusor overactivity does not change the diagnostic classification in 80% of men. The results provide evidence that bladder outflow obstruction can be reliably diagnosed based on pressure flow parameters recorded during voiding initiated by involuntary detrusor overactivity.
This study demonstrates that with effective multiagent chemotherapy, histologic subtype does not influence outcome. The high relapse rates in stage I MC subtype indicates that MC HD is biologically aggressive and systemic treatment with or without local irradiation may be indicated. The high relapse rate in stage IV patients appeared to be independent of histology.
Heavier drinking on predrinking evenings mainly results from longer drinking duration, with individual and situational factors playing a smaller role. Prevention efforts on reducing the time that young adults spend drinking and harm reduction measures such as restriction of access to on-premise establishments once intoxicated are recommended.
The study goes some way in supporting the notion that religious-cultural and gender differences in beliefs and behaviour towards alcohol may contribute to religious-cultural and gender differences in rates of depression.
The prognostic benefit of AAW was not clearly determined in this study. However, AAW might be beneficial in patients who have favorable prognostic factors for a response to AAW-that is, those who have received hormone therapy for a long period. However, AAW should not be done in patients who do not have favorable factors and who had a high prostate-specific antigen level at the time of their prostate cancer diagnosis.
Doppler threshold criteria reliably exclude those without posttransplantation portal vein stenosis and have high sensitivity for detecting portal stenosis. However, these criteria cannot discern the extent of stenosis.
Our study confirmed higher rates of some CVD risk factors in Roma compared with non-Roma. Our findings call for interventions aiming at decreasing CVD risks and improving health literacy among Roma, to reduce CVD morbidity and premature mortality.
Levosimendan, as well as standard therapy, improves myocardial function and symptoms of HF, irrespective of the loading dose administration. Treatment options for patients with end-stage heart failure refractory to conventional medical therapy are limited. Inotropic drugs play an important role in heart failure (HF).
Empiric arterial embolization may be advantageous in patients with a duodenal source of hemorrhage but not in patients with gastric hemorrhage.
Obesity is a prognostic factor favouring the development of systemic and local complications in this disease. Therefore, it should be used routinely as part of the initial assessment of the severity of a case of acute pancreatitis.
The management of BPH in France is globally similar among urologists regardless of their age or type of practice and does not correspond to current international and national guidelines. These guidelines, designed to limit the number of examinations in countries with ageing populations who are particularly affected by lower urinary tract symptoms, must be more widely diffused. However, this diffusion is not sufficient to ensure acceptance and application of these guidelines. It is therefore essential to conduct real practice surveys among practitioners to evaluate these guidelines, demonstrate differences and try to understand these differences.
These preliminary findings suggest that surgery negatively impacts attention/concentration in patients with MCI but not in normal individuals. This is the first study that identified a specific subgroup of patients who are predisposed to POCD.
This study showed that a cycle training of only three sessions was effective to improve children's cycling skills at short term and that cycle training within a traffic-free environment seems to be a useful first step in the development of safe cycling behaviors.
In light of these results, we recommend (i) development of management plans for a sustainable and rational use of Tupinambis merianae reducing the possible pressure on this species; and (ii) more studies be focused on the use of OTM and other natural products derived from animals that are used to treat other illnesses.
The distraction test screen generated large numbers of false-positives and a significant number of false-negatives, performing particularly poorly with moderate losses. Ages at diagnosis and aid fitting for screen failures were far older than currently accepted goals. There is little evidence that the distraction test can be made to work acceptably as a population-based screen.
Clinical assessment of HSV-2 disease severity as defined by the frequency of genital herpes recurrences does not predict the risk of transmission to sexual partners. Though patients with frequent recurrences are most likely to benefit clinically from suppressive therapy, frequency of recurrences is not helpful in identifying persons who are most likely to transmit HSV-2.
Analysis of severe blunt trauma patients with C. difficile, as compared with non-CDI patients, reveals evidence of increased inflammation, immunosuppression, worse acute kidney injury, higher NISS, greater days in the hospital and on the ventilator, higher organ injury scores, and prolonged clinical courses. This supports reports of an increased prevalence of CDI in a younger population not believed previously to be at risk. This unique population may have specific genomic or inflammation-related risk factors that may play more important roles in disease susceptibility. Prospective analysis may allow early identification of at-risk patients, creation of novel therapeutics, and improved understanding of how and why C. difficile colonization transforms into infection after severe blunt trauma.
These racial disparities may result from economic factors, exclusionary practices, or resident choice. Whether separation relates to inequities in care is undetermined.
Antepartum membrane stripping in GBS carriers appears to be a safe obstetrical procedure that does not adversely affect maternal or neonatal outcomes.
We found modest evidence for clustering of some health behaviours within workgroups, which could be due to social learning or selection into and out of workgroups. Future health promotion programmes at worksites should recognize the potential clustering of lifestyle behaviours within workgroups.
The reversal of Hartmann's operation appears to be a safe operation with acceptable morbidity rates and can be considered in patients, including those with significant operative risk factors.
The ISCSCI examination was found to have good to excellent relationships with MRI level in children with chronic SCI. Our results suggest MRI may be a useful adjunct for the determination of NL in children unable to participate with the examination. Our results also suggest caution in using the ISCSCI for the determination of completeness in young children. Further research into new methods (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) to determine completeness of injury is warranted.
: Late after polytrauma, women suffer more severe psychologic impairment than men who had similar injuries. This finding is independent of physical impairment and the subjective feeling of a good rehabilitation outcome. Clinically, women require special support even years after injury to improve their psychologic status. In the future, they might benefit from early concomitant psychologic treatment if mental problems are suspected.
Controlling for other predictive variables, ethnicity was related to pulmonary function perception ability, as Latino children were less accurate than non-Latino white children. This difference in perceptual ability may contribute to recognized asthma disparities.
While comparative studies should be performed with one-leg treated animals due to interaction effects, for proof-of-principle studies, operating two legs per animal may be justified as the welfare of the animals is warranted. This is a great benefit in the sense of the 3Rs because up to 50% of animals can be spared.
In this study, aspirin use to prevent stroke and coronary heart disease was higher among whites than African Americans, raising the possibility that differential aspirin use could contribute to the racial disparities in vascular disease mortality. Counter to our hypothesis, aspirin use was more common in the Stroke Belt than the rest of the country, so differential aspirin use in the Stroke Belt is unlikely to contribute to geographic disparities in stroke.
Small-angle esotropia, small-angle exotropia, and orthotropia are not equally desirable outcomes after surgery for infantile esotropia. Orthotropia is a decidedly better outcome than a small-angle esotropia, which is preferable to a small-angle exotropia.
Despite lower fresh transfer rates, elective single blastocyst transfer yields a similar projected cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate as in a policy with cleavage stage or blastocyst transfer depending on a good quality embryo count on day 3.
Recipients of DCDs beyond conventional acceptance criteria have equivalent early outcomes to standard DCD grafts. With careful selection of donors and recipients, these grafts can be safely used to expand the donor pool.
The Goldfinger dissector is a useful instrument for the establishment of RT. A five-step strategy using the Goldfinger dissector can quickly and easily facilitate an RT for a laparoscopic LHM in LRH.
Our work provides preliminary information for a standardized method potentially useful for genotyping rs153109, and suggests its utility as a candidate approach to evaluate IL-27 p28 polymorphisms as additional clinical predictors of response to therapies in HCV infected patients.
Poor survival of African American breast cancer patients seems to be related to their advanced stage at presentation and young age. To improve survival in these women, efforts should be concentrated on aggressive screening at a young age to detect the disease at an earlier stage.
Current guidelines concerning age and mitral valve prosthesis choice are not being followed for patients aged ≥65 years. With regards to in-hospital and mid-term mortality, this study demonstrates that there is no difference between prosthesis types.
The current results indicated that LMS and SMD do not share the same natural history. A limited prognostic impact of grade was observed in patients with SMD. Differences in response to chemotherapy should be taken into account in planning the therapeutic approach for patients with these tumors. The current clinical observations may correspond to the biology of a different disease and deserve further study.
Among families with large employers offering a single health plan, those from low-income neighborhoods are more likely to be switched to high-deductible health plans. In contrast, families with small employers offering a single plan are more likely to be switched to high-deductible health plans if they are healthier and have lower baseline costs. These findings suggest that families with children in high-deductible plans may represent two distinct groups, one with higher-risk characteristics and another with lower-risk characteristics compared with those in traditional plans.
A daily dose of 27 mg elemental iron, containing a heme component, given in the second half of pregnancy, prevents depletion of iron stores after birth in most women. An equivalent dose of pure inorganic iron seems less effective, but the sample size in this study was too small to demonstrate significant differences between the two treatment groups.
This study indicates that when using fresh-frozen cadaveric bone in biomechanical tests to simulate the orthopaedic clinical setting, specimen exposure time should be considered. The timing of testing should be kept constant between specimens to allow for a proper comparison. Furthermore, for fresh--frozen cadavers, the physical properties of bone may be detrimentally affected in biomechanical testing that exceeds the 50-hour time point after removal from the freezer.
The article points to a new intermediate stage between group and team. This intermediate stage is called semiparallel teamwork. The study shows that practical teamwork is not characterized by a synchronous ideal, but rather is about how to adaptively find acceptable solutions to a series of practical problems. The study emphasizes the importance of the team varying between different working modes, so-called semisystematics.
Among intermediate schoolchildren in Kuwait, oral hygiene practices were far behind the international recommendations. Special emphasis should be placed on children who have personal problems with their life, school and self-esteem.
Long-term postoperative use of topical ketorolac drops with the preservation of posterior capsule was found to be effective for the prevention of PCO in pediatric cataract surgery, at least during the period of this study.
Both MMC and HFN inhibited excessive fibrosis. However, there was no significant difference in the antifibrotic effects of MMC and HFN on surgically induced skin wounds. Moreover, combination treatment with both MMC and HFN failed to confer an additional antifibrotic effect on skin wounds when compared with treatment with MMC or HFN alone.
Oral nutritional supplementation of undernourished older people upon hospital discharge did not reduce disability, despite improving handgrip strength and modestly increasing objectively measured physical activity levels. Lack of an effect of the nutritional supplement used in this study may have been due to low adherence, suggesting that different approaches to nutritional supplementation need to be tested in this population.
In our study, incidence of PNX after SCVP placement was low, and PNX was not detected by intraoperative fluoroscopy or by routine postprocedure CXR. We conclude that the practice of routine postprocedure CXR after SCVP placement is not necessary and should be replaced with diagnostic chest radiography only if symptoms develop.
Based on our experience, we recommend ETV as the method of choice in children younger than 6 month of age.
Our results suggested that the variant genotype of XRCC4 rs28360071 and rs28360317 and haplotype analysis may be associated with PCa risk.
Given the sizes used, the full range of inventory provided by the manufacturer may be unnecessary, as surgeons will likely attempt a larger shell before a larger augment.
The ARS is an effective technique for horizontal bone augmentation in the mandible. Delayed dental implant placement when the alveolar bone width is narrower than 3 mm could minimize the risk of buccal wall fracture.
A substantial equivalence in structural and functional results in Achilles tendon ruptures surgically treated with and without addition of PRP is shown by present study. Clinical results, morphological features and jumping capability were similar in both groups. The addition of PRP to the surgical treatment of Achilles tendon rupture does not appear to offer superior clinical and functional results.
With accurate needle Gleason grading, ploidy is not helpful in predicting prostatectomy findings. However, ploidy correlates with prostatectomy stage and grade, and may be useful if accurate Gleason grading is a concern.
No gender differences were observed in response to CRT and long-term survival after CRT.
Rebound acid hypersecretion is probably an infrequent problem in on-demand treatment with PPI in patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease. A significant increase in p-CgA and s-gastrin was found after 6 months treatment. Fourteen days after withdrawal, CgA and gastrin returned to pretreatment levels. Overall, no aggravation of symptoms was found, but 1/3 experienced increased symptoms.
Primary tumour resection was independently associated to a better OS in patients with CRC and unresectable synchronous metastases.
The adult human eye conserves cells able to recapitulate certain neural developmental features. This observation opens new perspectives to study human neurogenesis and to provide an important source of neurons for transplantation studies in the retina and other regions of the central nervous system.
Although the DISC has been greatly improved since the initial version, the results suggest that additional revision is needed before clinicians or researchers use the DISC with younger children.
There was no improvement in VUR resolution rate following subureteric injection of Deflux(®) when an intraoperative cystogram demonstrated no reflux to be present immediately after injection. Of ureters that did not reflux on intraoperative cystograms, one-third displayed return of reflux on follow-up imaging, which suggests no learning curve and that failures are not likely to be caused by poor surgical technique.
Phosphorus was associated with seroprotection and seroconversion to influenza A after vaccination; these associations warrant additional studies with larger, more diverse population groups.
Studying transitions of smoking behavior based on six possible phases (i.e., never smoking, nonsmoking deciding, trying, experimenting, regular smoking, and quitting) might lead to more valid insights into predictors of adolescent smoking behavior.
Our hypothesis that early signs of physiological damage would be present in young adults given mismatches in childhood environments, as measured by growth markers, was not proven. This lack of association could be because age 36 is too young to identify significant trends for future health, or the associations simply not being present.
MNCOP-B is an effective regimen in intermediate and high grade NHL and easily manageable in the out-patient clinic. The incidence of mucositis is sensibly reduced as compared to the parental regimen MACOP-B reported in the literature; this result allows the use of MNCOP-B in older patients.
24% of GPs met the NHMRC diabetic retinopathy screening criterion prior to the workshop, and 94% following this brief training intervention. Australian GPs are capable of a much more significant role in community screening for diabetic retinopathy.
Even taking into account the varying definitions of "mountain accident" used in these countries, available data from the analyzed areas of the European Alps do not demonstrate a drastic increase in the number of fatalities. In the future, data concerning mountain accidents in the European Alps should be monitored according to standard definitions and stored by the International Commission for Alpine Rescue.
Plug and patch repair of unilateral inguinal hernia improves quality of life with a very low rate of procedural complications. Regarding freedom from pain, vitality, and physical activity there is significant improvement as compared to preoperatively. Therefore inguinal hernia repair should be intended in all elective cases and plug and patch repair appears as an excellent technique to improve quality of life.
Since GH3 cells showed a heterogenous uptake of 5-ALA in the flow cytometry profile, but not constantly high concentrations they might have a 5-ALA efflux mechanism, which still needs to be determined. In the case of AtT-20, the cells might need a longer time for the uptake due to their size or slow metabolism. We showed that the different cell lines have different uptake and metabolism mechanisms, which needs to be further investigated. The general uptake of 5-ALA allows the possibility of resection control and PDT for pituitary adenomas. But, the role of PDT for unresectable pituitary adenomas deserves further investigations.
Karatekas predominantly use upper-limb karate techniques. Karate's nature is intermittent, with fighting activities representing ~6% of total combat's duration and ~84% of actions lasting less than 2 s, with ~21-s mean time interval in between. Kumite combat sessions induced high La and near-maximal cardiovascular strain. Other key success factors should be investigated to properly discriminate winners and defeated athletes.
Physicians and patients have similar perceptions of the importance of various goals of communicating bad news, but inaccurate perceptions of the importance of particular goals to the other party. These findings raise important questions for future research and clinical practice.
A noninvasive estimation of FFR can be easily determined during exercise echocardiography. This index of global contractility is theoretically appealing for identification of limited contractile reserve and latent global left ventricular dysfunction.
Elevation of C-reactive protein values in familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, in the absence of signs and symptoms of local or systemic inflammation or systemic or recurrent disease, may suggest an upregulation of proinflammatory mechanisms, which is further exacerbated by the presence of coronary atherosclerotic disease.
This is the first report of a large pedigree with the clinical phenotype of HCH plus AN due to a FGFR3 mutation, p.Lys650Thr. This finding demonstrates the coexistence of both conditions due to the same mutation and it might represent a true complex, which should be further established by searching for AN in mild HCH patients or for HCH in patients with AN.
The value of MRI is limited in children with voiding dysfunction and a normal neuro-orthopedic assessment. This study should be reserved for patients with associated neuroorthopedic findings or complex skeletal deformity on plain x-ray.
A third of Canadians in this sample lacked data on tobacco in their electronic medical record. Younger, healthier people were less likely to have information about their smoking status. Efforts to improve the recording of tobacco-related information in electronic medical records, especially for younger patients, are needed.
Our findings suggest alcohol involvement of either or both in the couple increases the risk of severe IPV. Our findings also suggest female alcohol use may play an important role in determining the severity of IPV, MFPV or FMPV.
No. 16 (+) pancreatic cancer patients with age 60 years or older, tumor size 4 cm or less, and pPV(-) may benefit from resection.
It appears that presence of pelvic organ prolapse in early postmenopausal women is not helpful in predicting osteoporosis.
In active intravenous drug abusers, surgical treatment for infective endocarditis should be performed as extensively as possible and be followed by an aggressive postoperative antibiotic therapy to avoid high mortality. Early surgical intervention is advisable in patients with precipitous cardiac deterioration and under conditions of staphylococcal endocarditis. However, larger studies are necessary to confirm our preliminary results.
In the population, the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is up to 10 percent in middle aged women with high levels of total plasma cholesterol and may justify case-finding. In these women approximately 0.5 mmol/l of total plasma cholesterol can be attributed to the subclinical thyroid dysfunction. In men a similar correlation between thyroid dysfunction and total plasma cholesterol is seen, but the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is considerably lower.
Our results suggest that treatment with celecoxib does not potentiate the INR when taken with warfarin. Larger randomized trials are warranted to address the effects of coadministered warfarin and celecoxib on clinical outcomes.
In this pilot study of patients with cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules, FDG-PET/CT was not a predictable indicator of benign or malignant disease. Although a larger series may elucidate a role for FDG-PET/CT, the relatively low predictability shown in this study should caution clinicians about using FDG-PET/CT to consider foregoing thyroidectomy for cytologically indeterminate nodules.
Community-weighted mean values provided good predictions of mixed-species litter decomposition, converging to the predicted values with increasing species richness and in climates less favourable to decomposition. Under a context of climate change, abiotic variability would be important to take into account when predicting ecosystem processes.
Substitution of electrolyte-containing beverages is not likely to prevent water intoxication.
The proposed NMES models were able to partially amend the anterior sagittal imbalance of the paraplegic patients in bipedal posture.
The low vitamin D status can explain alterations in mineral metabolism as well as myocardial dysfunction in the CHF patients, and it may therefore be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of CHF.
Factors such as hypertriglyceridemia do not confound the comparison of apoB and non-HDL-C, further evidence that apoB is superior to non-HDL-C as a marker of the importance of the apoB atherogenic lipoproteins in cardiovascular risk.
Our study showed that patients suffering from social phobia and comorbid personality disorder showed a smaller decrease in specific social phobia symptomatology during treatment compared than patients with social phobia without personality disorders. However, a significant decrease in symptomatology occurred in personality disorder patients as well.
Despite the existence of sound policies, programs, and infrastructure, PA levels of children and youth in Wales are one of the lowest and sedentary behavior one of the highest globally. From the 2014 Report Card, the Family and Peer Influences grade improved from D to D+, whereas Community and the Built Environment dropped from B to C. These results indicate that a concerted effort is required to increase PA and decrease sedentary time in children and young people in Wales.
Overall, students were given relatively few opportunities to be the first to interact with any patient in any setting. They infrequently had an opportunity to independently generate a hypothesis or generate a management plan. Currently, the clinic offers the best opportunity for the student to complete these processes.
We demonstrate that cleavage tears are now visible on US using high-frequency transducers and tissue harmonic mode. However, the sensitivity remains too low, especially in patients with full thickness tear, postsurgical patients and patients that are poor candidates to US.
In this study, plain film was more sensitive than CT scout radiography in revealing ureteral calculi. However, the detection of stones 5 mm or larger had a sensitivity of 66% on CT scout radiographs; 77% (44/57) of the stones visible on plain films were also seen on CT scout radiographs. We therefore believe that CT scout radiography can be used as a baseline study in most patients with big ureteral stones.
Long-term clinical outcome and left ventricular function are good despite severe left ventricular dysfunction at presentation. Mitral valve repair or replacement is generally not necessary at the time of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery repair. Significant residual mitral regurgitation is present in some patients and can usually be managed surgically at a later date depending on its degree of severity.
SC LMWH use with thrombolytics seems to be feasible and safe. Prospective, large, randomized control trials are still required in order to confirm these results.
Few pregnant adolescents made informed decisions about maternal serum screening. Clinicians face a challenge to improve adolescents' knowledge about maternal serum screening.
PPTD is a safe surgical procedure for duodenal adenomatosis that avoids pancreatic head resection, provides high quality of life, and shows advantages over the pp-Whipple procedure.
BLA lesions block sevoflurane-induced amnesia. A role for the BLA in mediating anesthetic-induced amnesia may be a general principle of anesthetic action.
Within this multispecialty Women's Health Care Clinic, internal medicine physicians are practicing primary care and obstetricians/gynecologists are providing specialty care.
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the supine position is safe, effective, and suitable for the majority of patients. It offers the potential advantages of better urethral access, less patient handling, and the need to only drape once, thus reducing the overall operative time compared to the traditional prone position.
Despite the high incidence of hypertonia (63%) observed, none of the selected clinical characteristics could be identified as a risk factor for hypertonia.
Most pathology reports are incomplete for essential features needed for management and discussion of AMN with patients. Synoptic reports improve completeness of reporting for these tumors.
Administering smaller tidal volumes with a paediatric instead of an adult self-inflatable bag in unintubated adult patients with respiratory arrest maintains good oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination while decreasing peak airway pressure, which makes stomach inflation less likely.
Our findings demonstrate that the clinical outcome of CNS care is not inferior to that of JHD care, and patients attending CNS gain additional benefit in that they are better informed about their disease and significantly more satisfied with care than are their counterparts.
In patients referred with a clinical diagnosis of OSAS, RDW may be a marker for the severity of the condition. As RDW is usually included in a complete blood count, it could provide an inexpensive tool for triaging OSAS patients for polysomnography evaluation.
our study highlights: (i) the great heterogeneity in possible profiles of a future influenza pandemic; (ii) the value of being well prepared in every country since a pandemic may have heavy consequences wherever and whenever it starts; (iii) the need to quickly implement control measures and even to anticipate pandemic emergence through pre-pandemic vaccination; and (iv) the value of combining all available control measures except perhaps travel restrictions.
Our analysis supports the practice of transplanting HCV+ donor kidneys into HCV+ recipients to alleviate waiting list burden. Recipient HCV positivity should not influence selection of induction agent.
Over the past 10 years, there has been a substantial increase in diagnoses of gonorrhoea and infectious syphilis, and probably chlamydia, in men who have sex with men in Australia. However, it is unlikely that changes in the pattern of STI transmission are responsible for the recent divergence in HIV rates between Australian states because there is little evidence that trends in STI also differ by state.
Correct and accurate preoperative assessment of CLP remains challenging. Despite the wide range of diagnostic modalities, the definitive preoperative identification of malignant or high-risk CLP is inaccurate. Because of this, a significant portion of the patients undergo pancreatic resection for benign or inflammatory lesions that are not potentially life-threatening. Possible serious complications after pancreatic surgery are the main reason for precise selection of patients with cystic affections recommended for surgery.
There were no significant effects of renal function on the incidence of cataract of any type. The effect of moderate or worse renal impairment on incident cataract surgery depended on age. However, the interpretation of this effect is uncertain because of additional factors that may be involved in patients having surgery.
Pre-operative joint sampling obtained by either aspiration or tissue biopsy is advocated in cases where peri-prosthetic infection is suspected and provides the only means of determining infecting organism prior to revision. Overall, only half of all pre-operative cultures matched completely the findings of intra-operative samples in terms of both the microorganism(s) encountered and their corresponding antimicrobial sensitivity profile. Clinicians should be vigilant regarding the possibility of the patient acquiring further microorganisms or the development of new antibiotic resistance by the time of revision, especially in historic pre-operative cultures. Broad spectrum antibiotic therapies should therefore be employed until final microorganisms and antimicrobial sensitivities are confirmed from intra-operative samples.
The prevalence of psychiatric illness, including substance abuse and dependence, is not static in the homeless population. Service systems need to be aware of potential prevalence changes and the impact of these changes on service needs.
The electrophysiological effects of (S)-compared to (R)-propafenone were not very pronounced, so it still remains questionable whether one of the enantiomers might be clinically superior to the other, or to the racemic mixture.
The aspect ratio between ruptured aneurysms and unruptured aneurysms was found to be statistically significant, and almost 80% of the ruptured aneurysms showed an aspect ratio of more than 1.6, whereas almost 90% of the unruptured aneurysms showed an aspect ratio of less than 1.6. This study therefore suggests that the aspect ratio may be useful in predicting imminent aneurysmal ruptures.
The article elucidates how the status that professionals ascribe to the body has vital implications for what they regard as relevant and how they interpret the information they have collected. On this ground, we challenge both the prevailing and tacitly accepted separation between the physical body and human experience and the view of knowledge underpinning EBM and PM. The growing molecularization of the body veils decisive sources of human illness.
LSG had a modest effect on nutritional deficiencies in our patients at 1-year postsurgery. Focusing on the preoperative nutritional status and tailoring a specific supplemental program for each individual should prevent postoperative deficiencies.
Needle size did not affect diagnostic yield or accuracy for malignant lesions. Smaller needles such as 22-gauge needle would appear to be suitable for transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of malignant pulmonary lesions.
The 2013 ACC/AHA 10-year ASCVD risk estimator was better than the SCORE and QRisk II indices in RA, but still failed to identify 55% of high risk patients. Furthermore adjustment of threshold and EULAR modification did not work well.
Semiconstrained total elbow arthroplasty can be a reliable choice of treatment if other internal fixation methods fail. Significant pain relief and improvements in elbow function and stability can be achieved with semiconstrained elbow arthroplasty in patients with distal humeral nonunion.
The results provide evidence of the economic validity of the CHP's role in the public sector, where there is no net income to serve as a policy guideline. The conclusion can be drawn that CHP services are more effective than physician services (or 'no CHP services').
The concentrations of propofol in salvaged blood were low, irrespective of the different infusion rates. These results demonstrate that salvaged autologous blood would not contribute to sedative or anesthetic effect.
No association was found between β-thalassaemia minor and metabolic syndrome despite insulin resistance, which was shown in subjects with β-thalassaemia minor.
We found that children born after assisted conception had a lower risk of developing infantile autism then their matched controls. Our observations could possibly be explained by the mother's health status before and during early pregnancy. Our findings require further investigation in larger studies.
This study reveals no risk of urge or stress urinary incontinence at long-term follow-up after vaginal hysterectomy, compared with conservative treatment.
The introduction of centrifuges into all GPs across NHS Grampian has significantly reduced the effect of seasonal variation in serum potassium results. There has also been a concurrent reduction in the number of cases of spurious hyperkalaemia. This exercise has significantly improved the overall quality of potassium results reported to Primary Care.
The authors report a higher prevalence of latex sensitization in the obstetric population than in nonpregnant subjects undergoing gynecologic surgery.
Measurement of AC atrophy with 3T MR imaging may provide additional diagnostic clues for FTLD and AD. Conversely, SI atrophy measurement does not provide an additional benefit in the evaluation of FTLD and AD, owing to a considerable overlap in the average thickness of bilateral SI.
"In-clinic" HIV-1 testing is highly accepted, and most infected clients in treatment will learn their status. Nevertheless, voluntary testing data are likely to yield considerable underestimates of the true rate of infection among injection drug users.
These findings suggest that the routine use of drains may be abandoned in uncomplicated thyroid surgery, since serious postoperative bleeding rarely occurs and hematomas can be treated by needle aspiration if drains have not been placed. Furthermore, the use of drains prolongs hospital stay and increases the risk of infection.
Women with anxiety and no CAD history had higher rates of ischemia than women without anxiety. Results suggest that anxiety symptoms, many of which overlap with those of CAD, might mask CAD symptoms among women (but not men) and contribute to referral and diagnostic delays. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
The elective operations studied induced a hypertensive response. The response was more marked in trainees than in trainers, particularly if the trainee was operating independently.
We found that preoperative diagnosis of porcelain gallbladder was difficult. Moreover, there was no association between porcelain gallbladder and cancer. Therefore, when porcelain gallbladder is suspected, surgeons should decide operation, based on the symptoms rather than the possibility of coexistence of gallbladder cancer.
Treatment with amisulpride results in a similar pattern of limbic cortical over striatal D(2)/D(3) receptor blockade to that of other atypical antipsychotic drugs. This finding suggests that modest striatal D(2) receptor occupancy and preferential occupancy of limbic cortical dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors may be sufficient to explain the therapeutic efficacy and low extrapyramidal symptom profile of atypical antipsychotic drugs, without the need for 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism.
We observed presence of pro-atherogenic lipid profile in INS. Elevation of oxLDL may reflect increased oxidative stress and higher risk of atherosclerosis in INS, therefore it seems to be relevant to find patients of risk of atherosclerosis to consider lipid lowering treatment with antioxidants.
The RNFL thicknesses were thinner on the side of the headache compared to the contralateral side in the migraine patients with unilateral headache, but this difference was not statistically significant.
The mechanism for enlarging lesion size during radiofrequency irrigated-tip ablation is that higher power levels can be used. There is no virtual electrode effect caused by the highly conductive surroundings of the tip during irrigation. In vitro this effect is shown to be opposite: it decreases lesion size.
We posit that earlier diagnosis and fetal treatment, prior to clinical findings suggestive of fetal anemia, may improve long-term outcomes by enhancing oxygen delivery to the tissues of the developing fetus.
Resection of a solitary non-small cell lung cancer recurrence might provide long-term survival in highly selected patients. However, surgical resection might be contraindicated if the primary tumor is stage II or III.
The DVR(®) plate restores the bony anatomy to within acceptable limits in the majority of patients who have sustained a fracture of the distal radius although of all parameters investigated, the widest variability is seen in volar tilt.
ECA shunting could be considered as an alternative to standard ICA shunting. Suitable cases can be identified on the basis of the ECA test.
It appears that sustained rotation influences blood velocity in the extracranial vessels. This may have relevance in patients with abnormal blood flow who are candidates for cervical manipulation.
Presence of β-cell autoantibodies in our cohort of patients with CFRD (8.5%) appeared to be greater than in the general population and was associated with female sex, earlier onset of diabetes, and higher insulin requirement. Insulin pump therapy was used significantly more often in patients with β-cell antibodies. Severe hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis were significantly more frequent in CFRD with β-cell autoimmunity compared with β-cell antibody-negative patients with CFRD.
The rate of upstaging when ADH is diagnosed on CNB at our institution is 18 %, and routine excisional biopsy is currently recommended for all patients. However, patients<50 years old with focal atypia only and no residual calcifications postbiopsy may represent a low-risk group who could potentially avoid excisional biopsy.
The results provide robust evidence for the positive effects of CS on medical-surgical nurses' well-being at work.
Residents are sufficiently trained for basic and intermediate laparoscopic procedures during residency training. However, they are not sufficiently equipped to perform advanced laparoscopic procedures without supervision. We should consider training advanced procedures especially to a selected group of residents because most gynecologists do not perform these procedures after residency. The learning curve for advanced procedures continues to rise after finishing residency for those who keep on performing these procedures, therefore an additional fellowship is recommended for this group.
The results of this study indicate that Dutch NHPs observe all the requirements for EAS in 41% of cases. In the remaining cases, shortcomings were found: NHPs allowed too little time between the first discussion and the actual administration; they did not always keep written records; or they signed a death certificate testifying that the patient had died a natural death.
This study shows that some aspects of defecatory function after rectal excision could improve with a colonic reservoir.
Models of care require a multifaceted collaborative approach for sustainability. Implementing elements of the CCM in developing models of acute care may improve patient outcomes and decrease unnecessary admissions to hospital for older people.
The prevalence of EN in the endemic Croatian areas appears to be decreasing. For the first time, we failed to detect any EN patients in a village that was previously considered endemic, which might indicate that EN is diminishing.
Experiencing feelings of failure may affect children's physical safety, in particular among pre-adolescents. Possible mechanisms are perceptual deficits and response changes occasioned by the stress experienced after exposure.
Charges for pediatric urolithiasis management increased by 65% from 2006 to 2012 despite stable frequency of patient encounters. The utilization of computerized tomography in pediatric urolithiasis increased as well.
For practitioners of spinal manipulative therapy, routine screening for abuse is an essential part of history taking. Awareness of a patient's experiences with domestic violence is required to make appropriate adjustments in the management plan.
Considering radiation exposure risk, protective gear is necessary to ensure safety and efficacy of URS lithotripsy. Efforts to reduce radiation dose before and during surgery are required when ureteral calculi are in upper locations or have large HU, or the patient has a high BMI.
Both sample selection bias and selective partnership reporting can influence the level of agreement between men's and women's reports of sexual behaviors. Although men report more casual partners than do women, accounts of sexual behavior within reported relationships are generally reliable.
Concordance between the bispectral and patient state indices is relatively weak, whereas both are thought to reflect the same clinical target, the hypnotic component of anaesthesia. As a consequence, further studies are required to compare reliability of both indices as indicators of different levels of hypnosis.
The decision to use trastuzumab in HER2-amplified pT1ab tumors must balance their poor outcome against intrinsic financial limitations in LMCs. Patient selection criteria needs fine-tuning, and resource-sensitive regimens must be explored.
IBS may involve an autonomic hyper-responsiveness to visceral stimuli, which occurs throughout the entire gut, is independent of acutely perceived GI symptoms, and does not necessarily involve HPA axis activation. Women with IBS show altered cellular immune responses to food intake, which may at least in part be mediated by adrenergic mechanisms. Thus, autonomic disturbances may have implications for cellular immune function along the neuroendocrine-immune axis in patients with IBS.
Healthy volunteers, when given information about the expected physiological effect of infrasound, reported symptoms that aligned with that information, during exposure to both infrasound and sham infrasound. Symptom expectations were created by viewing information readily available on the Internet, indicating the potential for symptom expectations to be created outside of the laboratory, in real world settings. Results suggest psychological expectations could explain the link between wind turbine exposure and health complaints.
We conclude that pre-IVF treatment with oral contraceptive pill or gestogen combined with the flare protocol in women at high risk of or with a history of poor ovarian response, as defined in this study, did not appear to result in an improvement in outcome of IVF-embryo transfer.
According to the results, respiration presented a greater disturbing effect on body balance in low back pain subjects.
Workers in the SL-Rehab group have lower FC than their working counterparts. Many workers in both groups with CMP demonstrated insufficient FC. Not the pain itself, but personal and work-related factors are related to insufficient FC.
DWI and the combined technique are more accurate and sensitive than DCEI in the detection of prostate cancer; however, DWI and DCEI play complementary roles in the accurate detection of prostate cancer.
The indication for FNA in otherwise resectable patients should be made carefully, keeping in mind the rate of diagnostic errors and of complications, as well as the possibility for diagnostic VATS of peripheral lesions.
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of death or HF within 30 days of an acute coronary syndrome. However, we did not find any excess risk of death or HF associated with use of K(ATP) channel inhibitors at the time of an acute coronary syndrome, raising doubts about the hypothesis that sulphonylureas inhibit the cardioprotective effects of myocardial K(ATP) channels.
Results provide evidence that health systems can implement strategies to encourage their members to use more primary care services without driving up physical health costs.
Insulin pumps are relatively complex devices, with serious health consequences resulting from improper use. For IPs to be used safely and independently by blind and visually impaired patients, they must include voice output to communicate all the information presented on their display screens. Enhancing display contrast and the size of the displayed information would also improve accessibility for visually impaired users. The IPs must also come with accessible user documentation in alternate formats.
Histopathological findings of the present study are consistent with a cellular immune response of natural killer cells against metastatic brain tumors, presumably stimulated by the ionizing energy of focused radiation.
In our series, ACL reconstruction using a femoral tunnel drilled through an AMP provided better rotational stability and anterior translation than drilling the femoral tunnel using the TT technique. This difference likely is not relevant from a clinical and functional viewpoint. The 2 groups of patients were not significantly different in terms of development of degenerative changes seen radiographically at a minimum follow-up of 5 years.
Pelvic atherosclerosis caused no statistically significant changes in bladder smooth muscle contractile responses to bethanechol, KCl, or resting tone. The difference between these and previously reported results may have been a result of the more gradual onset of atherosclerosis in our model, which better mimics pelvic organ ischemia in the elderly.
NCT and cycle length alternation can arise during orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia when the retrograde delay is sufficiently short. The characteristics of the alternation, presence of continuous recovery curves, intranodal location of the alternation, and mathematical modeling suggest that the alternation is predictable from the known functional properties of the AV node without postulating dual pathway physiology.
Ladd's procedure in single ventricle heterotaxy patients who are tolerating enteral feeding should be performed after physiologic palliation to a more balanced circulation, ideally after cavopulmonary connection. Symptomatic neonates pose management challenges. Timing of abdominal surgery should be carefully considered, given the significant risk of mortality in these patients.
The impaired results of PRJPT in both the paretic and non-paretic ankles of stroke patients are surprising when one expects that the non-paretic side would be preserved under the control of the healthy hemisphere.
An intact splenic flexure and mesenteric vessels were the most prevalent in patients who underwent reoperation at our institution. Full mobilization of the splenic flexure, high ligation of the mesenteric vessels, anastomotic stricture resection, and re-anastomosis can be successfully performed with satisfactory outcomes.
Necrosis-rescuing HBOT should be given with caution in patients with locoregionally recurrent and then successfully salvaged head-and-neck cancers; if it cannot be omitted entirely, deferring HBOT 9 months or longer after cancer re-treatment may be prudent.
On an individual level personal assessments of health, well-being and joint pain are nevertheless unsteady even within the timeframe of two months. This is why, even now, RA patients still cannot plan their lives as non-affected people can.
Grade 3 varicoceles have a greater number of large veins compared with grade 1 varicoceles.
LVR is a safe procedure for using to treat full-thickness ERP in elderly patients. Mortality, morbidity and hospital stay are comparable with published rates for perineal procedures, with a 10-fold lower recurrence.
Patients with stroke may make more functional gains if their postacute care includes an IRF. This finding may have important implications as postacute care delivery is reshaped through health care reform.
These data indicate that obsessive-compulsive symptoms are more related to certain forms of compulsivity than to impulsivity. These findings have important implications for diagnostic conceptualizations and neurobiological models.
To be considered analytically significant, the BEC had to decrease by 0.013 (2.6%), 0.028 (1.9%) and 0.045 mg/g (1.8%), respectively at starting concentrations of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mg/g.
Clinically lymph node-negative T4 melanoma cases should be strongly considered for SLN biopsy, regardless of Breslow depth. SLN lymph node status is the most significant prognostic sign among these patients. T4 patients with a negative SLN have an excellent prognosis in the absence of ulceration and should not be considered candidates for adjuvant high-dose interferon.
PTLD did not differ significantly in distribution between SOT and HST cohorts. PTLD after HST occurred early and had shorter survival.
In conclusion, no correlation between dental caries and salivary ionic composition as well as α-amylase secretion rate was found in DS children.
Batter's shoulder is an uncommon form of posterior instability in hitters affecting their lead shoulder. Most athletes are able to return to play at the same level after arthroscopic treatment of posterior capsulolabral lesions.
FBPJ cannot be recommended for the routine closure of the pancreatic remnant after LP, as it was not technically achievable in 72% of the cases. Moreover, the technique does not seem to reduce the risk for POPF compared to the hand-sewn closure.
HAQ components estimate EQ5D better than total HAQ. Adding DAS28 to HAQ components does not result in better utility estimations.
The findings of this study suggest that providing feedback to agencies or individuals who participate in some descriptive studies may be used to promote improvements in clinical care.
Modern endovascular therapies for acute ischemic stroke do improve clinical outcomes when implemented in the setting of a dedicated comprehensive stroke team.
ALPPS leads to sufficient hepatic hypertrophy within 2 weeks, avoiding PHLF in most patients. In patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma, ALPPS should be applied with extreme caution due to high morbidity and mortality.
H. pylori is not associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients who receive stress ulcer prophylaxis, whereas patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation are at high risk. A prophylactic eradication of H. pylori is not justified.
Measurements of vaginal squeeze pressure differ depending on the vaginal probe used. Results from published studies using various probes should, therefore, not be compared or combined in systematic reviews or meta-analysis.
The BP response to the VM is related to a broad range of clinical and neurohumoral parameters of CHF. Whether or not it is also related to prognosis remains to be determined. Nevertheless, this easily applicable test should be part of the assessment of patients with CHF.
Post-only adult scoliosis surgery achieved similar correction to A/P surgery while decreasing blood loss, operative time, length of stay, and avoiding additional anesthesia. Complications, radiographic, and clinical outcomes were similar at over 2-year follow-up.
VEGF, COX-2, and Ki-67 were overexpressed in the majority of Barrett's samples. The length was inversely associated with VEGF expression and directly associated with Ki-67 expression.
The following conclusions can be drawn from this study: 1. Patient with idiopathic OA of one hip is at increased risk of developing OA in the other hip. 2. The outcome of the other hip cannot be predicted only on the basis of the evaluation of its radiographic indices. 3. Among the different indices, WBS seems to have a strong influence toward the development of OA.
Metformin may be useful for inducing ovulation in anovulatory women who do not have hyperandrogenism. This effect may be independent of a lowering of androgen or insulin levels.
The prognosis of patients in the AC group is generally worse than the BC group because of the close anatomical relationship with the tracheobronchial tree. However, radical esophagectomy is recommended for patients at stages less advanced than T4.
Edaravone dose-dependently increases rehabilitation gain according to DeltaFIM-M and DeltaBI scores in patients with cardioembolic stroke, and a similar trend was also observed with respect to DeltaBI score in patients with atherothrombotic stroke. This suggests that the total amount of edaravone used is associated with its efficacy for rehabilitation gain.
Postcontrast delayed MR images after Mn-DPDP administration were helpful in distinguishing hepatocellular from nonhepatocellular lesions, but were not useful for lesion detection and had limited utility for lesion characterization, since benign and malignant hepatic lesions looked the same.
Experienced SLPs were shown to be highly accurate in recognizing stuttering and nonstuttering exemplars from young CWS speaking in an unfamiliar language. The findings suggest that judgments of occurrences of stuttering in CWS are not generally language dependent, although some exceptions were noted.
Some reasons were patient-dependent; others were study-dependent. With 'not interested' as the most common reason, cited by over 50% of patients who declined, recruitment measures should be targeted at stimulating patients' interest. Additional efforts may be needed to recruit older participants. However, reasons for refusal were consistent regardless of gender.
If a method of automatic delineation shall be applied, this method must be applied to every lesion separately. However, to facilitate the delineation in daily practice, when I(n)/I(t) is ≤25%, lymph nodes could be delineated in accordance with tumor uptake, keeping an absolute difference in radii<5 mm.
This study shows that in contemporaneously treated groups of Hispanic and white men at the same institution pathological stage was similar between the groups. To our knowledge this is the largest comparison of surgically treated prostate cancer between these 2 groups. Further followup in terms of PSA outcome in these groups is planned.
The prevalence of hepatitis B among pregnant women in Cameroon is high, and the pattern tends towards high infectivity and therefore increased risk of perinatal HBV transmission. These highlight the need to step up preventive efforts against hepatitis B infection and perinatal HBV transmission in our community.
After adjusting for the other factors investigated in this study, language fluency was a consistently significant predictor of the use of PubMed, MedlinePlus English and MedlinePlus en Español. This study may support the need for multi-language search tools and may increase access of health information resources from non-English speaking countries.
Unexpectedly, no improvement in pain control was observed. Efforts are still needed to improve cancer pain management.
We identified no case of PJI from urinary origin in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria whether or not they had been treated with specific antibiotics.
In SSc, the time to diagnosis is longer for women than men after the onset of Raynaud's phenomenon, suggesting that there may be possible biologic differences in the progression of disease or in the health care trajectories of men and women with early SSc.
These findings suggest that serum B(12) at levels of 300 pg/ml or less are not associated with isolated UI or isolated FI but may play a role in DI. A possible association of low B(12) levels with DI is intriguing because of the implications for treatment and prevention. More immediately, medication side effects should be considered when evaluating this problem.
Among medical students with no previous exposure to laparoscopic trainers, female students perform worse than male students after adjusting for confounding factors. This difference must be recognized by training programs while using simulators for training and evaluation.
Opportunistic screening for AAA is not a realistic alternative to a formal screening programme but may improve the detection rate in the community.
Hemodialysis patients showed low acyl-ghrelin levels and seem to present an acyl-ghrelin resistance and there was no correlation between inflammation and this orexigenic hormone.
Small- to medium-sized practices appear to respond to PR and financial incentives by greater use of CMPs. Future research needs to investigate the appropriate mix and type of incentive arrangements and quality reporting.
The high level of self-monitoring combined with a low usage of eHealth-tools seems to indicate that there is a need for a more tailored approach to stimulate the use of eHealth-tools by PWE. Further research should focus on this aspect, e.g., what PWE need in order to make more use of eHealth-tools in their self-care.
The changes observed were not associated with anaemia during the 15 weeks of MF exposure. However, the decrease in bone marrow cells of the red cell lineage and the changes in iron storage detected at the end of the experiment did not allow the possibility to be ruled out that exposure to 50 Hz MFs may induced delayed biological effects.
Use of multidisciplinary expert panels is a useful method for estimating health benefits on program level or for groups of patients. But assessments from single panelists, and for single patients may be seriously biased.
These data demonstrate that obesity in itself does not seem to be an underlying factor, but does impose a risk to vasculogenic impotence by developing chronic vascular disease.
Histopathologic analysis of coronary lesions with early loss after successful PTCA suggests that thrombus may not play a significant role in this angiographic phenomenon.
Our experience demonstrates that postoperative tests of the defibrillation function of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators rarely reveal dysfunctions. As testing is unpleasant for the patient and not free of complications, tests might be restricted to those patients in whom a dysfunction is suspected and to those patients in whom class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs have been added to the antiarrhythmic drug regimen.
Intraarticular pathology at the time of PAO is common. Future studies are needed to rigorously address the use of arthroscopic intervention during PAO and the impact on clinical outcome compared to PAO alone.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may elevate blood pressure and antagonize the blood pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive medication to an extent that may potentially increase hypertension-related morbidity. Although certain NSAIDs and antihypertensive agents could be more likely to produce these effects, the underlying mechanisms require further study.
Community dwelling stroke subjects display the same level of automaticity of walking as elderly controls, but both elderly controls and stroke subjects are less automated than young controls.
Substantial disparities exist in approaches to OIP for patients with pemphigus, including the decision to treat, type of treatment, and risk stratification among pemphigus experts.
Our findings suggest that the current RDAs are adequate for older women's intake of riboflavin, vitamin B-6, and folic acid, but should be raised for vitamin B-12 and for vitamin C.
Our long-term results showing a low recurrence and morbidity rate of laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication encourage us to continue to perform this procedure as the primary surgical repair in all GERD patients, independent of their esophageal motility. Laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication has proven to be a safe and successful therapeutic option in GERD patients.
The outcome was similarly favorable in cases of synchronous hepatic metastasis and in cases of metachronous metastasis. Delaying resection allows accurate understanding of the number and location of hepatic metastases, and is beneficial in determining candidates for surgery and in selecting surgical procedure.
We found higher rates of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with PAD than reported previously. Patients with diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease were not more likely to meet the goal LDL-C level than those without these comorbidities. Clinical practice may be catching up to clinical guidelines.
A higher-than-anticipated percentage of patients treated with growing rods required unplanned reoperation following final fusion. Long-term follow-up after final fusion is necessary to determine true final results. Patients and parents need to be counseled regarding the possibility of further surgery after final fusion.
The need for aortic clamping in selected cases of PT did not seem to affect the transplanted kidney, even without protective measures, provided that the ischemic time was short.
Tumor length is a predictive factor for long-term survival in elderly patients with ESCC, especially in T3-4 grade or nodal-negative patients. We conclude that 4.0 cm may be the optimum cut-off point for tumor length in predicting survival in elderly patients with ESCC.
Although the field of primary care LBP research often seems to progress slowly, the Forum highlighted several important, promising developments that could substantially improve LBP research and primary care practice.
Cholangioscopy after successful endoscopic or percutaneous therapy of complicated choledocholithiasis seems to be useful, because in bile ducts radiographically free of stones, cholangioscopy detects stone fragments in some patients. Further studies are needed to demonstrate if cholangioscopy can reduce the rate of symptomatic relapse after treatment of complicated choledocholithiasis.
A follow-up visit for patients with an isolated posterior vitreous detachment can be justified to detect the small percentage of asymptomatic retinal breaks. Although a subjective reduction of vision is the symptom most predictive of serious posterior segment pathology, it would be unsafe to identify particular subgroups of patients alone for careful examination.
The use of speculum lubricant gel significantly decreased pain during the SE in gynecologic oncology patients.
We suggest that dermatoscopy is efficient enough to identify pathognomonic changes in NCP in SSc as well as VCAP and find dermatoscopy as a very easy applicable and convenient method than VCAP although VCAP facilitates a more detailed evaluation of NCP.
Nonoperative management of grade 5 renal trauma is feasible. Prompt surgical intervention is required for those with major vascular injuries. Superselective arterial embolization can be an excellent option in patients with continuing hemorrhage and who have pseudoaneurysms. Patients with UPJ disruption can be salvaged by initial drainage of the urinoma followed by deferred correction.
Although the analyses have only found marginally significant evidence of global space-time clustering for cases of type 1 diabetes diagnosed in north-east England, there were two notable findings. First, there was evidence of clustering amongst females and secondly clustering was confined to cases from more densely populated areas. These findings are consistent with a possible aetiological involvement of an infectious agent.
This stroke network concept leads to a substantial improvement of stroke management. Telemedicine contributes to an early etiological assessment and fills the gap of specialized stroke expertise in neurologically underserved areas.
Sweeping of membranes beyond 40 weeks does not reduce the need for formal induction of labour at 42 weeks. Although it is safe, the majority of women felt uncomfortable during the procedure.
Over a mean follow-up of 5 years, we observed no recurrences after APA resection. Molecular features had no discernable impact, indicating that long-term follow-up may be unnecessary.
Lay people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a psychiatrist should break confidentiality to protect a patient's wife.
A higher degree of apical vertebral rotation may therefore be an indicator of mechanical LBP in patients with LSS and DLS. Decompression with fusion should be recommended in these patients.
Persistent central nervous system trauma due to idiopathic SCH might provide an unexpected hint about the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.
Adjuvant hysterectomy after unsuccessful ICBT does not seem to increase late toxicity and reduces the risk of pelvic recurrence and may improve survival. The role of adjuvant hysterectomy after suboptimal chemoradiation merits further investigation in clinical trials.
Comparing of PPV, SVV and POPV, PPV is the most correlate with percent change in cardiac index and the most effective dynamic index for predict fluid responsiveness in adult septic critically ill patients who are on controlled mechanical ventilator, followed by SVV and POPV.
Bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling for plasma ACTH measurements before and after CRH stimulation successfully confirmed the diagnosis of pituitary dependent Cushing's disease in 15 of 17 patients (88%) in whom this diagnosis was suspected on the basis of conventional biochemical testing. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, is superior to bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling for the localization/lateralization of pituitary microadenomas in patients with Cushing's disease. Therefore, bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling should be reserved for the assessment of those patients with Cushing's syndrome in whom either the results of biochemical tests are equivocal and/or subsequent pituitary magnetic resonance imaging gives unconvincing results.
Changes in visceral perfusion during IABP assistance were significantly related to balloon length, but not to its volume. This could be relevant for the evolution of balloon engineering design in order to reduce the incidence of mesenteric ischemia following IABP. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings.
Criteria for termination of resuscitation correctly predicted 100% of those who died when all the criteria were met. More importantly, no survivors would have had resuscitation stopped. Duration of CPR seems to be a strong predictor of mortality in this study.
The prevalence of NAFLD is positively associated with hematocrit levels. Though the cause-effect relationship between NAFLD and hematocrit still needs further investigation to clarify, the elevated hematocrit in NAFLD patients may be of significance to link NAFLD and cardiovascular disease.
Paravertebral catheter analgesia with morphine patient-controlled analgesia seems as effective as thoracic epidural for reducing the risk of postoperative complications. The authors additionally found that paravertebral catheter use is associated with a shorter hospital stay and may be a better form of analgesia for fast-track thoracic surgery.
Given the low rate of well differentiated HER2 positive tumors, falling within the range reported for false negative IHC tests for HER2, and the absence of published data demonstrating a beneficial effect of trastuzumab therapy in this subset of patients, HER2 testing should not be considered a standard of care for all patients with well-differentiated breast cancer.
All patients with PCBDS had varying degrees of fibrosis. Prolonged injury-repair interval and portal hypertension were the important parameters correlating with secondary biliary cirrhosis. Early repair of biliary stricture is recommended to prevent liver fibrosis. A successful relief of biliary obstruction may halt and/or reverse pathological changes in the liver.
These results suggest that inflammation and pro-coagulation processes may be an important pathway connecting sleep disordered breathing and cardiometabolic disorders in women of these ethnic groups and that inflammation may be a particularly important pathway in African Americans.
The CT attenuation value of renal calculi can help to differentiate stones that are likely to fragment easily on ESWL from those that would require a greater number of shock waves for fragmentation or may fail to fragment on ESWL.
Family mealtime interactions may be a mechanism by which respiratory disorders are associated with separation anxiety symptoms in children, potentially through increasing the child's capacity to cognitively frame asthma symptoms as less threatening, or through increasing the child's sense of security within their family relationships.
Irrigation before primary closure did not significantly alter the rate of infection or the cosmetic appearance in our study population with clean, noncontaminated facial and scalp lacerations.
Respiratory contamination is very common among ventilated infants. Therefore, judicious use of mechanical ventilation cannot be overemphasized. Gravitational force can ameliorate the onset of respiratory colonization. The mechanism and clinical applicability of such observations need to be explored further.
those with an integrated service provide higher quality care to older people. The provision of high-quality care for continence appears to be dependent upon well-organised services with personnel who have the appropriate training and skills to deliver the care.
Open surgery for extensive thoracic and thoracoabdominal repair in chronic TBAD may be performed with acceptable early and mid-term outcomes. TEVAR for aortic complications in patients with chronic dissection may be successfully performed as a first-stage procedure in order to stabilize the patient and serve as a 'bridge' to secondary open surgery. However, close surveillance is mandatory for the timely detection of aneurysm enlargement, malperfusion or impending rupture after TEVAR.
Using a decision-cutoff of 95% predicted mortality using MPMI IIo had a very high specificity in predicting death after intensive care unit admission, although with a low sensitivity. This information can be used to support clinical judgment regarding the very ill patients who are unlikely to benefit from intensive care unit admission.
Full breast-feeding was associated with the lowest illness rates. Minimal (less) breast-feeding was not protective. Breast-feeding conferred similar health benefits in all economic groups.
Internal fixation performed in ICU patients with fever or in close conjunction to the diagnosis of systemic infection led to a 5.6% infection rate, which compares favorably with historic infection rates for fixation of open or closed tibia and femur fractures.
The relationship between disease severity before transplant and quality of life after transplant is different depending on the index of disease severity used (MELD vs CTP) and whether the assessment of quality of life is general or specific to transplant-related symptoms.
An overestimation of minimum pedicle diameter in the transverse reconstruction occurs when the coronal pedicle angulation increases, and in the coronal reconstruction when the transverse pedicle angulation increases. Therefore, pedicle angle should be determined using both coronal and transverse reconstructions and utilized to reduce the risk of overestimation of the true pedicle diameter.
Conduct further research of guided imagery as an intervention for reducing pain and anxiety utilizing randomized controlled trials with a diverse sample of patients.
More maternal deaths occurred in the medical than in the obstetrics wards at the facility. The leading causes were hepatitis, hemorrhage and puerperal sepsis. Most of the deaths were non-preventable as the women were critically sick at admission; however, substandard care and health service deficiency were contributory in some of the cases.
The majority of children with CVS were subclassified as having migraine-associated CVS. The migraine-associated subgroup had less severe vomiting, manifested symptoms typical of migraine headaches, and had higher response rates to anti-migraine therapy. These findings strengthen the relationship between migraine and CVS.
Antibiotic treatment alone may be effective in the treatment of acute postoperative spinal infection when diagnosis is prompt. Aggressive surgery may be not necessary and may be reserved for patients who fail conservative treatment.
It is concluded that a paediatrician or paediatric registrar is not required to routinely attend repeat CS under epidural anaesthesia, but should be present for repeat CS under general anaesthesia.
This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis C and we could not find any relation. Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy.
Although transection of the hernia sac during laparoscopic TEP repair may cause seromas, our study demonstrated that transection of the hernia sac did not cause significant postoperative complications, including recurrence. Transection of the hernia sac is an alternative technique for laparoscopic TEP repair in cases with difficult hernia sac reduction.
Cancer symptom awareness and cancer survival are associated. Campaigns should focus on improving awareness about cancer symptoms, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas. Efforts should be made to alleviate barriers to seeking medical help in women with symptoms of breast cancer.
We suggest performing lateral osteotomy without creating subperiosteal tunnels.
In the Auckland setting, physical examination would appear to be a safe and reliable method for the stratification of patients for either operative or conservative management.
As the first known mediation analysis of tai chi for reducing low back pain-symptoms, it provides initial evidence that it may do so by having an effect on cognitive appraisal outcomes such as pain-catastrophising and information for choosing appropriate process measures for future studies. As tai chi is growing in popularity as an alternative treatment for patients with chronic musculoskeletal conditions, it is important to gain a better understanding of how it might work using confirmatory mediation analysis alongside future RCTs.
It is plausible that effective implementation of interventions targeting syphilis epidemics can have an indirect effect of mitigating the spread of HIV. The possible effects of STI should be considered in the design, implementation and evaluation of public health strategies and programs.
These results are inconclusive about the role of monoaminergic dysregulation in recovering alcoholics. They also question the utility of these CSF measures to predict alcohol cue reactivity in patients who have been sober at least 1 month.
A greater effort aimed at dissemination of information, provision of technical know-how and material resources could be the answer to at least part of the problems identified. In addition, greater national and international efforts are needed to stimulate the debate and build consensus on harm reduction activities in prison.
While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.
No significant correlation was obtained between the incremental increase in adenoid tissue volume and TMV or the incremental increase in TMV and adenoid tissue volume. There does not seem to be a developmental relationship between adenoid tissue volume and TMV.
The increases in cell proliferation, vascularity and HIF-1α after surgical rotator cuff repair appear consistent with a proliferative healing response, and these features are not seen after GCI. The increase in the glutamate receptor NMDAR1 after GCI raises concerns about the potential excitotoxic tendon damage that may result from this common treatment.
Time of presentation was not related to the clinical factors studied. Early recognition of stroke in children is an important goal for families and health care providers.
In patients with DTC, the intensity of follow-up should be adjusted to new risk estimates evolving with time. The first rhTSH-stimulated Tg is an excellent predictor for remission, independent of clinical stage at presentation. Second negative rhTSH-Tg stimulation is additionally reassuring and can guide less aggressive follow-up by the measurement of nonstimulated Tg and neck US every few years.
Smoking any type of cigarette is far more risky than abstaining altogether. Although the results obtained comparing tar levels are limited because of lack of repeat measures of smoking during follow-up, potential residual confounding factors, statistical imprecision, and failure to show a dose-response relationship, results do support the hypothesis that persistent smokers will reduce their tobacco-induced health risk if they smoke cigarettes with<10 mg of tar. However, the data do not permit quantification of the benefits of switching to lower-tar cigarettes. Worldwide legislation to limit tar levels to 10 mg as an absolute maximum is recommended, while recognizing that this must be part of an integrated approach to tobacco control.
Subspecialized attending radiologists who interpret ED examinations outside their area of expertise have error rates similar to those of radiology residents. Nonradiologists have significantly higher error rates than radiologists and radiology residents when interpreting examinations in the ED.
NCPAP is clearly effective in relieving the sleepiness of OSA compared to a control group identical in every way, except for receiving a nasal pressure inadequate to control the OSA.
Patients with acute urinary retention, age 80 years or older, with retention volume greater than 1,500 ml., no evidence of instability and maximal detrusor pressure less than 28 cm. water are at high risk of treatment failure. However, despite treatment failure the detrusor may recover in patients younger than 80. Therefore, prostatectomy should still be performed in this group (less than 80 years old) even if preoperative urodynamics suggest an unfavorable outcome.
In this cohort of patients who underwent orbital floor fracture repair and did not receive oral post-operative antibiotics, no infectious complications were identified. The routine use of these medications may not be necessary.
A simple and modest behavioral training for practicing physicians has potential to positively affect physician-patient relationship interaction quality. It will be important to evaluate the effect of more extensive trainings, including those that work with physicians on a broader set of communication techniques.
Long-term follow-up data corroborate the use of stapled IPAA for ulcerative colitis. Future studies should assess whether a less intensive surveillance strategy is safe 10 years after surgery.
Cytological screening is less sensitive in women ≥ 40 years while VIA has a uniform sensitivity for both groups.
The rarity of isolated lung metastasis in gastric cancer suggests the limited value of computed tomography thorax as a routine staging tool for gastric cancers.
ECG and CXR helped diagnose heart disease in four patients thought to have no heart disease, helped to rule out lesions in seven patients with possible heart disease, helped diagnose heart disease in five patients thought to have possible heart disease, and helped confirm heart disease in nine patients. In these days of cost containment, routine ECG and CXR continue to be valuable tools for the pediatric cardiologist in evaluation of patients with heart murmurs or chest pain.
Early PAPP-A, NT and later triple testing offers comparable detection for trisomy 21 to published data for first trimester combined testing but feasibly achieve the national target for 2010 of 90% detection of trisomy 21 for<2% SPR.
High exposure to animals could explain the frequency of sensitization to pets in this population. However, emotional attachment and prevalent indirect exposure to animals among sensitized patients make avoidance recommendations impractical or impossible to achieve.
Our study results support a fundamental re-evaluation of the role of neck pain in migraine.
This retrospective study highlights the overall better survival of PDAC patients presenting with acute and/or chronic pancreatitis than those without as contrary to previous reports which stated the poor prognosis of PDAC patients if associated with underlying pancreatitis.
The durability of rheumatic mitral valve repair in the current era has improved and is comparable to the outstanding durability of repairs for degenerative disease, even in the adult rheumatic population. Modifications of standard repair techniques, adherence to the importance of good leaflet coaptation, and strict quality control with stringent use of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography have all contributed to the improved long-term results.
The increase in external rotation suggests that the modified Bristow procedure does not initially restrict joint motion. Translational stability can be restored in a 20% bone loss model without a bone block, suggesting the importance of the soft-tissue sling.
This study highlights the potential effects of the new criteria for adherence on patients with obstructive sleep apnea and their clinical care. These data were taken from a study that was not designed to examine these criteria, so controlled trials are needed to better understand the effect of the guidelines on adherence and treatment outcomes.
Our data suggest that aEOC patients with optimal cytoreduction who underwent SRL did not show a significant improvement in survival irrespective of each histological type.
Nephrectomy with lymph node dissection can provide a durable disease-free survival in a proportion of patients with regionally advanced renal cell carcinoma and limited lymph node metastases.
Women with a diagnosis of TPD showing TVR values of> 1000 dynes × s/cm5and elevated levels of CRP are at high risk of preterm delivery. An impaired maternal cardiovascular adaptation during pregnancy in these patients might suggest a possible higher risk for subsequent future cardiovascular disease. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley&Sons Ltd.
Among pregnant Latinas, negative motivations intervene in the association between depression and contraceptive intentions. For nonpregnant Latinas, intentions intervene in the association between self-efficacy and contraceptive use. This study underscores the importance of depression screening during pregnancy and encourages practitioners to target contraceptive motivations to improve contraceptive use.
A physician is the first choice for all kinds of military ground force missions while a paramedic can be a reasonable substitute for missions of short duration, close to definitive care.
SHBC and MHBC interventions may systematically differ not only in the number of behaviors targeted, but also in the numbers and type of BCTs used. This study demonstrates that intervention content should also be considered when assessing the relative effectiveness of SHBC and MHBC interventions.
The vast majority of patients who underwent a MIP were surgically cured. Although recurrence rates remain higher in the familial hyperparathyroidism group, these data suggest that this alone should not be a contraindication to MIP.
Variation in the number of simple process-of-care indicators across provider groups or health plans is associated with differences in patient-centered measures of quality, but assessment of the quality of cardiometabolic risk factor control will require more advanced clinical performance indicators.
The period of hospitalisation may not be an appropriate time to initiate ACP but may be a milestone that can lead to discussions. GPs should be alert to that opportunity after discharge from hospital.
Poor oral health is significantly related to children's smiling patterns and the way others perceived their smiles. Poor oral health may prevent children from expressing positive emotions, which can impact their social interactions and the way they feel about themselves.
CM is a relatively safe procedure with a high diagnostic yield. As long as PET scanning remains available at a limited level, CM remains the gold standard in The Netherlands for patients with apparently operable NSCLC.
Amlodipine seems to be superior to valsartan in decreasing UAE. To reduce cardiovascular risks, endothelial dysfunction, and microinflammation, these factors are taken into consideration while prescribing antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients.
Policies aimed at increasing participation in leisure-time physical activities in youth may improve population health but are unlikely to prevent the development of social inequalities in health.
The classical criteria are not completely reliable and are observed only in half of our stellate images, whereas microcalcifications are often present but are not predictive of an associated malignancy.
The speech perception selection criteria can confidently be expanded to 60% from a conservative perspective and even up to the 80% range if the use of a contralateral hearing aid is highly expected.
Evaluation of staining intensity revealed better cause-specific survival in patients with negative or low inhibin-βA immunolabeling intensity. Therefore, although of some use, semi-quantification of immunohistochemical reactions might not be definitive for evaluation of the inhibin-βA subunit as a prognostic marker in endometrial cancer patients. Therefore, staining intensity evaluation should be performed in addition to semi-quantitative analysis. Further research is warranted to elucidate the possible implications of inhibin-βA and endometrial carcinogenesis.
Our results demonstrate, in a little population of patients evaluated with a comprehensive neurologic assessment, that weekly paclitaxel is related to a very high incidence of peripheral neurotoxicity. Follow-up data obtained in a subset of patients indicate that peripheral neurotoxicity is reversible.
Our data demonstrates that Th-2 immune response, exhibited through increased IL-4 and low IL-2, constitutes a fundamental feature of CAE.
Diagnostic performance of fecal leukocytes is suboptimal and may not warrant its continued use in developing settings, as it promotes antibiotic abuse, and on the other hand increases the risk of overlooking patients with invasive diarrhea who may Benedit from antibiotic treatment. Combination of epidemiological and clinical data with either fecal leukocytes or fecal lactoferrin may provide a more efficient approach.
High temperamental activity may contribute to the development of a physically inactive lifestyle. More evidence is needed with regard to gender differences among participants in similar study settings.
Obstetric malpractice lawsuit and frequent worry about lawsuit are associated with higher propensity of recommending cesarean delivery in common obstetric settings.
A local tuberculosis program can use a systematic recording of treatment delay as a quantifiable variable to monitor the infectious pool, and can also serve as a key indicator of program performance.
Resection of parathyroid adenomas in patients meeting El Escorial criteria for ALS did not alter the course of ALS. PHP and ALS appear to be coexisting but unrelated disorders.
In patients with syncope of unknown origin, an early (within first 3 minutes of TT) asymptomatic fall in total peripheral vascular resistance is a significant predictor of a positive final result of the test.
Type II endoleaks occur in nearly 15% of patients treated by EVAR. The early incidence varies only slightly with graft type. The long-term prevalence and clinical significance are masked by different treatment patterns, spontaneous resolution, newly evident endoleaks, and aneurysm size at initial treatment.
Stakeholders generally support the establishment of a national clinical trials support initiative. Consideration must be given to the sustainability of such an initiative, in terms of funding, staffing, expected research outputs and permanence of location.
Continuation of antiplatelets until 2 days before coronary artery bypass in Asian patients in our institution is unlikely to increase the risks of bleeding and perioperative transfusion. Taking antiplatelets within 24 h of surgery seems to be associated with a higher rate of 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding, and an increased risk of blood product transfusion. Thirty-day and 1-year major adverse cardiovascular event rates were higher in patients without antiplatelet treatment.
In contrast to standard transmitral Doppler filling indices, Doppler tissue early diastolic velocities are not significantly affected by physiological manoeuvres that alter preload. Thus Doppler tissue velocities during early left ventricular diastole may provide a better index of diastolic function in cardiac patients by providing a preload independent assessment of left ventricular filling.
Young patient age is associated with different analgesic prescription patterns in children treated in the ED for a long bone fracture.
Despite differences in age, education, and occupation between physician sex offenders and sex offenders in general, the same assessment procedures can be recommended for examining both groups. Although the sample size is small, results suggest that physicians who commit sexual offences should be scrutinized by phallometric assessment of sexual deviance and especially for neurological and endocrine abnormalities.
We conclude that it is possible to train selected specialist oncology nurses to manage major depression in patients with cancer in the context of an appropriately constituted multidisciplinary team.
Nosocomial A. baumannii infections represent a significant clinical problem because of their high incidence, lack of susceptibility to the most commonly used antibiotics, and the often inappropriate treatment, which favors the development of multi-drug-resistant strains.
For clinicians prepared to consider treatment in patients with elevated hsCRP levels, hsCRP measurement should be included as part of health screening packages to selected patients based on individual cardiac risk assessment.
This preliminary series suggests that VEIL can reduce morbidity, including hospitalization times,compared with standard open surgery. Oncologic results are premature but seem similar to the results from the conventional open operation. VEIL is a promising minimally invasive approach for radical inguinal dissection in penile cancer patients with nonpalpable or low-volume palpable inguinal disease.
About 1 in 200 patients with AS undergo cervical spine surgery. The surgery is often successful and complications are usually minor. Neck pain is often better after surgery and any remaining neck symptoms do not significantly affect the patient's sleep or functional activities. In this retrospective study, the long term outcome of cervical spine surgery in patients with AS appears to be good.
Angiogenesis factor correlates with survival in endometrial carcinoma.
The footplate color is important in the choice of the type of perforator.
A pelvic belt is most effective in a high position, while a tension of 100 N does not reduce laxity more than 50 N.
Presence of contagion suggests collective action may reduce value destruction brought about by safety incidents that result in significant injury or loss of life.
Bilateral pulmonary metastasectomy was performed safely with thoracoscopy in patients with bilateral oligo-metastatic sub-pleural lesions and the one-stage approach was a feasible option in bilateral single lesions. Preoperative PET scan could help predict intrathoracic recurrence after thoracoscopic metastasectomy.
The absolute value of baseline lung function appears to be an important confounder in the analyses of BOS, and should be considered in future risk factor analyses.
In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe LV enlargement, improvement of LVEF after revascularization is unlikely to occur. Conversely, in patients with relatively preserved LV size, a higher likelihood of functional recovery may be anticipated.
The present study suggests that the rise in thyroid cancer incidence is now abating. It could reflect standardization in diagnostic procedures. Further studies, performed on a more prolonged period, are necessary to confirm these data.
A comprehensive medical history and systemic and laboratory evaluations should be considered a prerequisite to identify, manage, and report such rare conditions in routine clinical practice.
Women with PCOS have greater cardiovascular risk than controls. Within PCOS cases, however, the ultrasound appearance of polycystic ovaries does not appear to further intensify the cardiovascular disease risk profile of these women.
This is the first study to highlight the issues surrounding the transition to the 6-year PharmD programme in Thailand, which was initiated due to the need for higher levels of competency among the nation's pharmacists. The transition was influenced by many factors. Many participants perceived benefits from the new pharmacy curriculum. However, some participants were concerned about this transition. Although most of the respondents accepted the need to go forward to the 6-year PharmD programme, designing an effective curriculum, providing a sufficient number of qualified PharmD preceptors, determining certain competencies of pharmacists in different practices and monitoring the quality of pharmacy education still need to be addressed during this transitional stage of pharmacy education in Thailand.
Readiness to change ED behaviors varies considerably. Most patients reduced eating disorder behaviors and increased psychological functioning regardless of stages of change, indicating the benefits of treatment and effectiveness of treatment-as-usual for overall psychiatric improvement.
Our results suggest that higher pediatric admission rates may not be associated with higher rates of inappropriateness. Further research is needed, with a larger number of communities, to differentiate practice patterns more precisely and explore patient and family preferences.
A urinary dipstick testing algorithm for infection associated markers was derived for use in hospital patients to screen out negative urines. Two years after distributing the algorithm and promoting access to reagent strips and strip readers, a reduction in the urine workload has been seen against an otherwise increasing laboratory specimen load.
Pronounced (>2 mm) surface irregularities of the greater trochanter on conventional radiographs were associated with abductor tendon MR abnormalities.
Results suggest that physical activity during pregnancy is associated with lower risk for gestational diabetes among previously inactive women.
Drain-cytology was a quick examination that enabled us to specifically indicate both minute residual cancer and subsequent development of local recurrence even after R0 resection of pancreatic cancer.
Trends towards greater availability of paracetamol are paralleled by increases in its use for both non-fatal overdose and suicide. Paracetamol related morbidity and mortality seem to be less frequent in France where the quantity of paracetamol in a single purchase is limited. Although not conclusive, these data add to a body of evidence which suggests that restrictions in the quantity of paracetamol available as a single purchase in the UK may reduce suicide and liver failure related to paracetamol.
The association of cathepsin K with skeletal and cardiovascular disorders offers intriguing future applications for inhibitors of this potent protease.
Neonatal complete repair of patients with IAA is possible with low mortality. LVOTO was not a significant risk factor for hospital or late death in patients having complete repair of IAA during this period. The use of conduits for right ventricular to pulmonary artery continuity and the presence of a nonseptatable heart are important risk factors for further operation and will continue to provide added morbidity to these patients.
Changes in PFO (decreased, maintained, or increased) are common post-TKA and are not associated with a difference in clinical outcomes. Increases in anterior patellar offset led to increased patellar tilt, which was not associated with adverse patient satisfaction scores.
In contrast to findings of a preliminary study, our clinical trial suggests that gum chewing, although safe, does not reduce duration of postcolectomy ileus.
Rigid prosthetic ring annuloplasty, standard or 3-dimensional, provides early and sustained reduction of tricuspid regurgitation secondary to left-sided valve disease without need for an additional leaflet procedure. However, results are imperfect, possibly because other anatomic levels (subvalvular, papillary muscle, and right ventricular) contributing to its pathophysiology are unaddressed.
Tissue PCR is a sensitive and specific method for obtaining early and timely diagnosis of GUTB. Application of tissue PCR results can augment the diagnostic accuracy in histopathologically labelled granulomatous inflammations.
Secondary prevention pharmacotherapy after MI is not consistent with clinical guidelines. The relevant geographic variation raises equity issues in access to optimal care. Adherence was influenced more by the hospital that discharged the patient than by the primary care providers. Cross-classified models proved to be a useful tool for defining priority areas for more targeted interventions.
A perception of 'safeness' is a concept that may aid self-evaluation and we present a matrix that might be used by supervisors and educators to examine this and its relationship with confidence and competence.
These data suggest that, in men, measurement of serum triglyceride levels does not provide clinically meaningful information about CHD risk beyond that obtainable by measurement of serum cholesterol subfractions alone.
As postpubertal mumps in males is associated with a 40% incidence of orchitis, parents should be made aware that failing to immunize their children threatens the future fertility of their sons. Young men not immunized as children should be counselled and offered urgent vaccination. Clinicians should be aware that epididymo-orchitis may be secondary to mumps infection even with no history or clinical evidence of parotitis.
The implications of these findings are discussed.
Educational experiences that promote affective learning may enhance interest in geriatric careers among healthcare students.
The clinical picture does not recall any of the classical exanthems or their atypical forms.
Vitamin C is a potent acute vasodilator in both smokers and nonsmokers and is superior to diltiazem in preoperative coronary patients who need protection from vasospasm of the radial conduit.
Our results suggest that the separation of the two species should be attributed to a factor that does not include the current environmental conditions. However, as the caatinga is a biome that has existed in the area for at least the last 18,000 years, past conditions might have had an influence in the speciation process. The DNA Barcoding approach may be extended to these members of the subfamily Triatominae.
Salt intakes of the remote Indigenous Australian population are far above recommendations, likely contributing to the high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular mortality experienced by this population. Salt-reduction strategies could considerably reduce salt intake in this population without increasing risk of iodine deficiency at the population-level. These data add to the global evidence informing salt-reduction strategies and the evidence that these strategies can be synergistically implemented with iodine deficiency elimination programmes.
Paternal preconceptional radiation cannot be the sole cause of the excess in Seascale since it will not explain the excess among those born outside Seascale. It follows that, unless two causes are to be postulated, any single cause must be a factor other than paternal preconceptional radiation. On this basis, the association found among those born there, if not partly due to chance, may reflect an indirect relation with the true cause. The recent hypothesis about such paternal radiation has originated in a subgroup of the excess cases that have aroused concern.
The study findings indicate that, in general, lower body satisfaction does not serve as a motivator for engaging in healthy weight management behaviors, but rather predicts the use of behaviors that may place adolescents at risk for weight gain and poorer overall health. Interventions with adolescents should strive to enhance body satisfaction and avoid messages likely to lead to decreases in body satisfaction.
In patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, routine follow-up is more important for evaluation of treatment results and emotional support than of benefit in improving patient survival.
The data suggest that the tear film under a properly fit contact lens is less than the 9-microm axial resolution of our confocal microscope. Furthermore, the potential for undetected eye movement and accidental touching of the contact lens raises questions regarding the overall reliability of the measurements.
Most of the African American children attending 2 urban schools in low-income neighborhoods were overweight or had one or more risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. School-based screening programs in high-risk populations may provide an efficient venue for the screening of obesity and related risk factors.
We conclude that the use of fresh cells versus cryopreserved cells does not have an impact on outcomes, and selected patients can achieve long-term survival with DLI for treatment of relapse after transplantation, although the overall outcomes remain dismal.
Children born to HIV-infected mothers with advanced disease who escaped perinatal or early breastfeeding-related HIV infection are nonetheless at high risk of mortality and morbidity during the first few months of life. HIV-related immunosuppression appears to have adverse consequences for the health of infants, in addition to risks of vertical transmission.
Even though a multifaceted intervention can improve process of care measures for Whites and African Americans, further studies are needed to improve outcome measures, especially in African Americans.
This investigation showed that the presence of VUR affects DMSA patterns in children with first symptomatic UTI.
Three to 5 years after the CABG surgery no difference in neurocognitive deficits is found between on- and off-pump CABG patients, indicating that the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) may not be the main cause of late neuropsychological decline.
Army and civilian residencies prepare family physicians for the medical aspects of practice. Early training in management subjects could be enhanced. Civilian and Army programs could improve training in family medicine subjects.
Our study suggests the existence of two or three distinct classes of bipolar depression and a strong association with functional outcome.
These results appear to be consistent with claims that major supermarket chains are using alcohol discounts as loss leaders to entice new consumers.
Severely injured patients admitted to Level I trauma centers have a lower risk of mortality compared with patients admitted to Level II centers. These findings support the continuation of a 2-tiered designation system for trauma.
There exists no real area of anatomical safety in the temporal region. It seems, however, possible to define areas of relative safety that would be of great help for the surgeon or the morphologist wishing to approach pathologies of this region.
Neither damage, nor inflammation appear to be prerequisites for inducing anabolic and muscle growth responses in elderly individuals undergoing a high force resistance exercise with eccentric contractions.
The primary success in type A and B lesions is unaffected by the duration of a waiting period for elective PTCA. A waiting time of more than 12 weeks is associated with a lower success rate in patients with total coronary occlusions.
Disagreement on food classification among different NP schemes and inconsistencies deriving from nutrigenetic tests advocate more research into this area.
The corrected QT interval did not correlate with cardiovascular autonomic tests nor pupillometry results. The corrected QT interval therefore should not be used for the diagnosis of the severity of diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
These lesions seem to result from a uniform response of the vessel wall to injury. Their incidence is probably related in part to the degree of injury after trauma to the coronary ostia during cannulation for myocardial protection. Patients with the epsilon 4 allele might be genetically predisposed for a pathologically increased response of proliferative repair mechanisms after arterial injury. The complication can be avoided by not instrumenting the coronary ostia for direct antegrade cardioplegia but using retrograde delivery as an alternative method of myocardial protection.
Adherence to three of the prescribing indicators increased after the introduction of decentralized drug budgets. Workplaces with a public employer showed greater adherence to two of the prescribing indicators than private sector workplaces.
Although mind mapping was not found to increase short-term recall of domain-based information or critical thinking compared to SNT, a brief introduction to mind mapping allowed novice MM subjects to perform similarly to SNT subjects. This demonstrates that medical students using mind maps can successfully retrieve information in the short term, and does not put them at a disadvantage compared to SNT students. Future studies should explore longitudinal effects of mind-map proficiency training on both short- and long-term information retrieval and critical thinking.
Abnormalities in astrocyte cytoskeletal proteins are characteristic features for ALS, both in acquired and congenital forms of the disease. The cytoskeletal aberrations may lead to astroglial dysfunction and disturbances in glutamate uptake that may in turn increase the degeneration of motoneurons.
These results replicate previous findings that fatigue and depression are independently related to disability in those with CFS. A more complex statistical model, however, suggested that depression severity substantially influenced the strength of the relation between fatigue and disability levels across a range of domains, including complete mediation in areas involving psychosocial functioning. These results may aid in clarifying contemporary conceptualizations of CFS and provide guidance in the identification of appropriate treatment targets.
Intraabdominal enteric duplication cysts are increasingly likely to be detected antenatally. The majority are likely to remain asymptomatic for several months at least, after which a resection can be planned. The prevalence of gastric mucosa suggests that they should not be left indefinitely. Laparoscopically assisted resection of ileocecal duplications is safe and effective.
Self-assessed low physical capacity is a strong predictor for developing nonchronic and persistent LBP among pain-free female health care workers. Future intervention studies should investigate whether increased physical capacity, for example, through exercise training prevents development of LBP among female health care workers.
These data show that increasing obesity does not impair the reproductive outcome in GC cycles. Larger sample size is indicated to verify these findings. Furthermore, this study suggests that the standard metabolic screening used for GCs may lead to selection of healthier patients compared with women of comparable BMI who conceive outside of a fertility clinic setting, indicating the metabolic profile, rather than BMI, may better explain differences in pregnancy outcomes.
The GI is a valid property of foods because its value is similar in healthy control, hyper [I] and T2DM subjects, and is independent of subjects' metabolic status. However, II may depend upon the glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and HIE of the subjects.
In postmenopausal women with idiopathic macular holes, serum E2, LH, FSH bone metabolic markers and bone density are comparable to those found in women (of the same age group) free of macular holes. Women with macular holes are characterized by lower GH and IGF-1, which prompts further study.
The results from this project gave impetus to designing a more formal research study that could validate VASD use in clinical admission assessments.
In old age, GPs' judgement of vulnerability is not independently associated with lower treatment rates of both lipid-lowering drugs and antithrombotics, whereas a history of minor CVD is. Individual proactive re-evaluation of preventive treatment in older (female) patients, especially those with a history of minor CVD, is recommended. Key points Prescriptions of lipid-lowering drugs and antithrombotics in secondary cardiovascular prevention tend to decline with age. In this study with median age 81 years, 50% of participants received optimal treatment with both lipid-lowering drugs and antithrombotics. GPs' judgement of vulnerability was not independently associated with optimal treatment. A history of less severe cardiovascular disease was independently associated with lower prescription rates of lipid-lowering drugs and antithrombotics. Proactive individual re-evaluation of cardiovascular preventive treatment in older (female) patients, especially patients with less severe cardiovascular disease, is recommended.
The findings raise the possibility that adults presenting with the ADHD symptom picture may not have a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. If this finding is replicated, then the disorder's place in the classification system must be reconsidered, and research must investigate the etiology of adult ADHD.
It is crucial to provide sustainable economic support in conjunction with ARVs in order to make "positive living" a reality for PLHIV. A chronic illness grant, a basic income grant or an unemployment grant could provide viable alternatives when the PLHIV are no longer eligible for a disability grant.
This large-scale study, the first to link 2 national databases-UKCAT and UKFPO, has shown that UKCAT is a predictor of medical school outcome. The data provide modest supportive evidence for the UKCAT's role in student selection. The conflicting relationships of socioeconomic contextual measures (area and school) with outcome adds to wider debates about the limitations of these measures, and indicates the need for further research.
Pulmonary retransplantation for bronchiolitis obliterans offers long-term survival rates in the range of primary lung transplantation for selected patients. Long-term survival rates for retransplantation due to PGD are significantly lower, warranting restrictive use in this setting. In our experience with a limited number of patients, retransplantation for airway problems has shown excellent results. Pulmonary retransplantation for chronic problems is a plausible approach, provided that patients are carefully selected. Retransplantation for PGD should be avoided.
Deans and their "partner" hospital CEOs agreed on most of the attributes, skills, and responsibilities characterizing the successful clinical department chair. CEOs were biased toward patient care, clinical quality, and results, whereas deans placed more emphasis on research, education, and mentoring.
Long-term exposure to NO2is not likely to induce susceptibility to short-term PM10exposure in the overall population. However, an effect modification of NO2is probable in the elderly and in those suffering from arrhythmias and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Experience at the hospital level may contribute to the improvement of hospital management efficiency.
Neonatal mortality rates were not affected by the choice of a threshold. However, the use of a 1000-gram threshold underestimated the health burden of fetal deaths. This may in part reflect the exclusion of growth restricted fetuses. In high-income countries with a good measure of gestational age, using a 28-week threshold may provide additional valuable information about fetal deaths occurring in the third trimester.
Embolic sources were not identified in most patients but they did have systemic vascular risk factors and brain imaging features of "small vessel disease." A more generalised intrinsic process affecting many small cerebral vessels contemporaneously could explain multiple acute small subcortical infarcts. White matter hyperintensities, microhaemorrhages, and multiple small subcortical infarcts may share a common pathophysiological mechanism such as a diffuse cerebral microvascular abnormality which requires further exploration.
While a significantly increased risk of developing rosacea among smokers was observed in this study, ETR seems to be the disease of active smokers. Further studies are required for better understanding of the association between rosacea and smoking.
Among this sample of adolescent emergency department patients, high rates of multiple risky behaviors are reported. Patients endorsed interest in receiving interventions for these behaviors, regardless of whether they reported the behavior. Most used multiple forms of technology, and approximately 50% preferred a technology-based intervention format.
The use of opaque resin to mask discoloured dentine results in a decrease of bond strength.
Sex differences in PPI cannot be accounted for by smoking history, because they are present across a large sample of non-smoking normal controls.
1) The vast majority of antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis have a benign course, only 2/54 or 3.7% required a pyeloplasty. 2) Invasive investigations like an MCU are not necessary in most cases. 3) Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not required in all unilateral cases and in bilateral ones after VUR has been excluded.
In patients with acute PE, the indices of RVD derived from axial transverse images and the reconstructed 4-chamber views yield comparative values. Given the simplicity of the former analysis, it should be taken into consideration for risk stratification in acute PE.
AP is unnecessary if transarterial chemoembolization is performed within a reasonable time frame following computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging that showed a patent portal vein. Omitting AP potentially reduces contrast material and radiation burden to both the patient and the operator.
A minor leak is not trivial. Apart from the fact that major clinical leakage necessitates urgent reoperation, there were few other differences between major and minor clinical leaks in the frequency of other complications.
In contrast to former studies using tissue sections, our results suggest that nuclear texture features extracted from single cell preparations cannot be used as a reliable parameter for the determination of organ confinement in prostatic adenocarcinomas.
These results, therefore, suggest that the concept of schizophrenia, as a unitary entity with high comorbidity between positive and negative dimensions, is in part the result of Berkson's bias.
Early life influences may influence ovarian ageing, highlighting the importance of investigating factors from across the life course.
Our findings show that even though memory for pain and dyspnea is overall distorted, the extent of bias in symptom recall clearly differs between symptoms and groups. The observed increase of dyspnea reporting over time may have important implications for diagnostic assessment based on symptom reporting.
The changes in p53 expression seen in both types of IP compared with adjacent CM suggest that sinonasal and urothelial IP may share some common ground in terms of their evolution. Although p16 appears not to be directly involved in the development of sinonasal or urothelial IP, the differing recurrence patterns of sinonasal versus urothelial IP may be attributable in part to different p16 expression.
Hyperthyrotropinemia is relatively common in obese children, but autoimmune thyroid disease accounts for a minority of the cases. TSH levels returned to normal in the majority of patients even without thyroid hormone administration. No beneficial effects on body weight, body mass index, linear growth and body lipids were found in treated subjects, suggesting that thyroid substitution is not necessary in most cases.
Although our results showed that preoperative serum CA-125 levels might predict the optimal resectable patients, larger prospective studies are needed to prove its predictivity. Gynecologic oncologists should evaluate the sum of all criteria until more data are available.
Post-infectious FGIDs appear to be associated with smoking. Smoking is known to moderate gut immunity in other disorders such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. This study adds to increasing evidence for an organic basis to post-infectious FGIDs, perhaps moderated via inflammatory pathways.
There is no evidence that adjuvant docetaxel treatment is associated with an increased frequency of CNS relapse.
The results indicate that protein kinase C inhibition using low doses of bisindolylmaleimide alone produces cardioprotection, and isoflurane further enhances this protection. In contrast, high doses of bisindolylmaleimide are not cardioprotective in the presence or absence of isoflurane. A role for protein kinase C during isoflurane-induced recovery of the stunned myocardium cannot be excluded.
Identification badges do not appear to be a major reservoir for pathogenic organisms. Badges can, however, harbour disease-causing organisms and should be cleaned regularly.
To protect their family, the Chinese women postpone death until after the hungry ghosts have been fed and hopefully banished forever.
The procedures appeared to be safe and well tolerated by the patients, regardless of the actual impact of the endovascular treatments for venous pathology on the clinical course of multiple sclerosis, which warrants long-term follow-up.
Under reasonable assumptions, if the case progresses to wet AMD (1) AREDS with Visudyne is less expensive than Visudyne alone in every five-year time period for the cohort that is age 50-54 right now until they become 75-79; thus, the lifetime cost is lower; (2) AREDS with Visudyne yields more QALYs than Visudyne alone in every five-year interval; (3) under all but the most extreme assumptions, the conclusions reached are robust. Even when AREDS costs a little more, it yields more QALYs at a reasonable cost per QALY. Thus, AREDS antioxidant supplementation appears to be a dominant strategy for macular degeneration. Applied to the whole Canadian population, the potential medical cost savings for Visudyne treatment of neovascular AMD are 5.6 billion Canadian dollars in direct costs. These values would be tenfold higher for the USA, because of the currency and population size differences.
These data suggest more severe sinonasal disease in patients with class I-III mutations compared to patients with class IV-V mutations.
James Bond's level of alcohol intake puts him at high risk of multiple alcohol related diseases and an early death. The level of functioning as displayed in the books is inconsistent with the physical, mental, and indeed sexual functioning expected from someone drinking this much alcohol. We advise an immediate referral for further assessment and treatment, a reduction in alcohol consumption to safe levels, and suspect that the famous catchphrase "shaken, not stirred" could be because of alcohol induced tremor affecting his hands.
Co-administration of paracetamol and aspirin was not associated with a significant difference in endoscopic ulcer rates compared to either drug alone. There was a strong signal for increased endoscopic erosions and ulcers in the combined group compared to either aspirin or paracetamol alone.
PCO only represents a milder end of the PCOS spectrum.
Following a 5-year tumour-free period, there is minimal risk of recurrence and progression in T1G3 UBCs treated with TUR and BCG induction intravesical instillations. This finding supports a less intensive and potentially less invasive surveillance scheme of bladder follow-up and upper urinary tract imaging in patients without any recurrence.
The density decreases significantly after age 55 with the greatest change occurring between age 55 and 64. This decrease does not occur in the majority of HRT-users. Usually HRT maintains the density present at the time HRT is started. Density decreases after HRT is started in some women suggesting refractoriness to hormones. In fewer than 8% of women density increases commensurate with HRT. Any adverse effect of HRT may depend on the receptivity of the epithelial elements which, in turn, may be reflected by the mammographic density at the time HRT is started.
Interventions of longer duration may be required to influence complex behaviors such as physical activity and fat and fiber intake.
Vessel profiling offers a qualitative optimization of angiographic images and more exact quantitative analysis.
Moderate-intensity ECC cycling exercise tailored according to perceived exertion during a prior CON test is well tolerated. It corresponds to a limited muscular use of oxygen and to an isolated increase in stroke volume. It appears to be a feasible procedure for preconditioning before ECC training.
We conclude that amisulpride is effective in disorganized as well as in paranoid schizophrenia, but that symptom reduction in the disorganized subtype is less pronounced.
The incidence of delayed ICH in our study was 1%. However, none of the delayed findings were clinically significant. Among patients on ACAP therapy with a negative CT1 and a normal or unchanged neurologic examination, a routine CT2 is unnecessary. We recommend a period of observation to recognize those patients with symptoms that could be due to delayed ICH.
Even in the elderly population, older patients presented more frequently with severe disease and underwent more conservative treatment strategies. Older age was independently associated with a lower likelihood of surgery.
Because of the multiple safety measures required, the inter-operative delay is continuously increasing and, in this study, was equivalent to the actual operative time of the surgical procedures. The inter-operative period cannot be shortened below 20 min or so. The reduction of this period would only be possible by involving and coordinating the different personnel that contribute to performing an operation, by optimizing the procedures and by harmonizing materials. The lack of interest and the lack of concern for the most efficient use of resources within the public hospitals, as well as the recent legal and social constraints introduced in France, are the main factors preventing progress in these areas.
Female representation in medicine is increasing. In contrast to North American experience, very few UK female pediatric surgeons felt hampered by lack of mentorship or role models. Education and training committees need to work proactively to ensure training programs achieve clinical excellence to continue to attract women into pediatric surgery. For women in the United Kingdom, pediatric surgery challenges will also be met by ensuring healthy "work-life balance," along with flexibility in training and established consultant practice.
The AC displayed similar retention and clinical outcomes to those of the CP. However, the AC was inferior to the CP in motion stabilization, subsidence prevention, and fusion rate. Therefore, for patients who require strong postoperative motion stabilization, CPs rather than ACs should be used.
This study revealed that DRD2 TaqI A receptor polymorphism was not associated with the development of prolactinoma and its clinical characteristics. Future studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications of genetic alterations in prolactinoma.
Our exploratory study suggests that parks and walking areas, adequate handicap parking, and public transportation are associated with disability in older adults.
Chronic pramipexole treatment does not seem to affect autonomic balance during wakefulness. Considering that neither PSG data nor autonomic parameters are significantly modified by pramipexole, we hypothesize a non-dopaminergic autonomic dysfunction in RLS.
It seems acceptable to rely on MUAC as a single assessment tool for case finding and for admission of children with SAM to nutritional programmes.
Variations in information quality and consistency of the EDIS/EMR raise concerns about the 'fitness for purpose' of the information for care and planning, information sharing, research and quality assurance.
In the year of study, the modest loss of body fat recorded in the rainy season (<5% body mass) represents a successful physiological response to energy imbalance, and is unlikely to compromise adult productive and reproductive function.
Stimulated TF synthesis and secretion in vitro by HKC-5 cells is consistent with the hypothesis that uTF is produced by tubular cells influenced by mediators of disease states and provides a model for further mechanistic investigations.
Placental weight is linked to the offspring's birthweight, but is not clearly associated with pre-eclampsia risk, suggesting that placental weight is not a useful indicator for the placental dysfunction in pre-eclampsia.
Outcomes are comparable to those of North American series, but the incidence is lower overall and is higher among natives. Factors that correlate with outcome include age at time of surgery, post-PE complications, postoperative decline and rate of decline of bilirubin and AST. The latter had not been reported previously and may prove useful in planning therapy for partial responders after PE.
Although prematurity, opioid exposure and neonatal pain were significantly associated with brain volume, no major associations with neuropsychological functioning or thermal sensitivity were detected. Our findings suggest that morphine administration during neonatal life does not affect neurocognitive performance or thermal sensitivity during childhood in children born preterm without brain damage during early life. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.
UNE occurs less frequently and is less severe on the side of complete dislocation. Complete dislocation may have a protective effect on the ulnar nerve. Muscle Nerve 56: 242-246, 2017.
An increased SG level was an independent and potent risk factor for gastric epithelial lesions. However, it does not seem to relate with distal gastric tumor growth. Serial decreases in SG levels should be considered a warning sign in index hypergastrinemic patients with no prior Helicobacter pylori eradication.
FI and formula stretching were common, even among families receiving public benefits. Many families were cautious about using generic formula.
In a referral center for pulmonary hypertension in Brazil, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients evaluated for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy had a hemodynamically severe status and had elevated brain natriuretic peptide serum levels. There was a predominance of females in our cohort, and the prevalence of hematological disorders and schistosomiasis was low (less than 10%).
For all but very young mothers, there seems to be a negative effect on birth weight from living in areas of income deprivation, whatever their individual circumstances.
Survival in pediatric lung transplant has increased significantly over the years, but this improvement primarily reflects improvement in early survival. Survival in pediatric lung transplant after the first posttransplant year has not changed in more than 2 decades.
Cosmetic surgery may improve body image satisfaction of breast reconstruction patients and help to further meet their expectations.
This study could not validate the use of CRP levels, nor a 50 mg/L threshold, as predictive factors for a preexisting infection during bipolar hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture. As a consequence, new infection screening tools must be developed and validated.
In our sample, asthma was found to have no significant effect on respiratory muscle strength.
Parents were usually comforted by oncologists, but this was not achieved in the way suggested by communication guidance. Communication guidance would benefit from an enhanced understanding of how emotional support is experienced by those who rely on it.
There is poor correlation between ECG precordial voltages and echocardiographic LV mass. This relationship is modified by BMI. This finding may contribute to the poor ECG screening characteristics.
Children showed highly positive intentions toward a peer in a wheelchair, but intentions attributed to classmates were less positive, which suggests "social desirability" influenced their own ratings.
The education tool improved healthcare professional confidence, knowledge and may improve the quality of inpatient diabetes care.
In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant Peruvian women, especially in those without prophylactic iron supplementation. RLS patients described more EDS. Preeclampsia was more common in RLS. Our study is the first study to indicate a possible association between RLS and preeclampsia.
Laparoscopic repair using Prolene intraperitoneal mesh in umbilical hernia is a safe, efficient and rapid method, avoiding infections complications in obese or cirrhotic patients.
Neuroticism may link HLC and TAS due to the face validity of each construct. A sense of vulnerability is stated in each measure. This may foster somatic preoccupation. The data suggest HLC and TAS to be separate phenomena and further support the validity of alexithymia as a unique personality trait.
Patients with osteosarcoma treated in the last two periods had higher rates of limb salvage treatment and survival, with lower secondary amputation.
The health of children from different ethnic backgrounds is influenced by different social and economic factors. In practice and in research, "immigrants" and even broadly defined cultural groupings, such as "Asian immigrants", should be considered as heterogeneous.
The present study showed no association between subclinical epileptiform discharges and error rates as indicators of transient cognitive impairment in visuo-spatial and verbal short-term memory. Hence, other mechanisms have to be taken into account to explain the known cognitive deficits in patients with epilepsy.
Diabetics with CS complicating AMI have a higher-risk profile at baseline, but after adjustment, diabetics have an in-hospital survival rate that is only marginally lower than that of nondiabetics. Diabetics who undergo revascularization derive a survival benefit similar to that of nondiabetics.
While this study has a small patient sample size, it highlights the inconsistency of the role of antipseudomonal drugs also shown in other similar studies. The presence of P. aeruginosa in sputum of acutely ill CF patients prompts us to prescribe i.v. antipseudomonal drugs. If this approach was valid, we would expect to find a reduction in sputum colony counts and improvement in clinical parameters with the use of antibiotics to which the organisms were sensitive. The fact that such a relationship cannot be consistently demonstrated in this and other studies suggests that the use of antipseudomonal therapy in these patients requires more critical bacteriological and clinical evaluation.
T/N ratio on (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT is an independent predictor of survival in patients with suspected recurrent glioma, along with size of recurrent tumor on MRI.
If Health of the Nation targets on reducing the proportion of overweight individuals in the population are to be met, public health policy should focus on places as well as people.
Experience and seniority may not be sufficient to detect procedural errors during central line insertion. Instructional videos improve error recognition.
We did not find evidence that GAMSAT and structured interviews are good predictors of performance in medical school. Our study highlights a need for more rigorous evaluation of Australian medical school admissions tests.
This is the largest study showing that Fontan circulation prompts early, progressive and eventually irreversible liver damage. Precautions should be taken immediately after Fontan, to protect this fragile population.
Disclosure of the diagnosis had an impact on social and emotional QOL. Patients with lung cancer need psychological support at the beginning of their disease.
The main finding from this study is that GPs are not in the main following, or accessing, the CPGs that have been developed. Strategies are required to create a culture in which evidence based guidelines are used and valued within general practice. Such a culture in which the processes of development, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of CPGs are well established, may take 5-10 years to achieve.
Strong correlations between predicted and achieved mean doses indicate that RapidPlan could accurately predict achievable mean doses. This shows the feasibility of using RapidPlan DVH prediction alone for automated individualized head and neck plan QA. This has applications in individual centers and clinical trials.
A possible method to reduce adjacent-level fractures after vertebroplasty in patients with reduced bone quality could be the use of a lower modulus cement. Therefore, mixing cement with biocompatible fluids could prove useful to tailor cement properties in the operating theater.
These results are suggestive that rurality may have provided some protection from mortality during this influenza pandemic. This may have been due to a mix of remoteness and greater social distancing among rural residents. However, the differences in mortality rates between towns and cities may have reflected other factors such as the more organised provision of community care in the larger towns and cities, when compared to smaller towns.
We found in our patients with LP a lower prevalence of positive serology for HCV than that reported in the literature. Since all studies have found patients with LP without infection by HCV, we think that other factors in the pathogenesis of this dermatosis need to be studied.
Taken together, our results show that, despite a reduced abdominal SAT IL-6 expression, brisk walking does not seem to exert a favorable impact on the cardiometabolic risk profile of overweight to obese women, irrespective of their menopause status.
The clinical and radiological features of patients admitted with SAH after a preceding bout of headache did not differ from those without such an episode, and are clearly dissimilar from those after documented rebleeds. The findings challenge the existence of minor "warning headaches".
NICU infants have higher baseline salivary cortisol than healthy full-term newborns. There is a change in baseline cortisol by age in both groups. Full-term infants as well as NICU infants show an increased pain response to a standardised nappy change.
Major cost source in open-angle glaucoma treatment is medication, up to 74% of annual costs. In addition, it seems that higher resource consumption and higher treatment costs do not increase the patients' HRQoL as assessed by the 15D instrument.
This study describes, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide profiling of breast cancer from Saudi ethnic females. We demonstrate the involvement of the lipid metabolism pathway in the pathogenesis of breast cancer from this region. This finding also highlights the need for strategies to curb the increasing rates of incidence of this disease by educating the public about life-style risk factors such as unhealthy diet and obesity.
This study supports the previous evidence for the no need for performing laboratory investigations for patients on isotretinoin therapy.
In patients with PAF and no documented common-type AFL, PVI alone prevented the occurrence of AF in 82%, whereas in patients with AFL/PAF, cavotricuspid isthmus cryoablation and PVI were used successfully to treat sustained common-type AFL but appeared to be insufficient to prevent recurrences of AF. In this population, AFL can be a sign that non-pulmonary vein triggers are the culprit behind AF or that sufficient electrical remodeling has already occurred in both atria, and thus a strategy that includes substrate modification may be required.
Return to subjective baseline erectile function following radical prostatectomy is rare. The IIEF-5 questionnaire may not adequately reflect patients' experience. This should be considered in preoperative patient counselling.
Our preliminary results suggest that poorer neuropsychological performance may be associated with impaired real-life functioning in subjects with OCD.
Symptoms consistent with IBS and functional diarrhea occur more frequently in people after bacterial gastroenteritis compared with controls, even after careful exclusion of people with pre-existing FGIDs. The frequency is similar at 3 and 6 months. Our findings support the existence of postinfectious IBS and give an accurate estimate of its frequency.
The underlying symptomatology of psychogenic nonepileptic seizure patients differs between those who do versus those who do not accept the diagnosis. The complexity of additional symptoms may contribute to poorer outcomes in those that do not accept the psychogenic nonepileptic seizure diagnosis.
The laparoscopic approach provides all the benefits of a minimally invasive procedure to the patients. Due to the different locations of renal vessels, it is safe to approach the ureter first when performing nephrectomy. When performing pyeloplasty, omitting the prior stent placement helps in the identification and dissection of the renal pelvis.
Although technically challenging, the initial results suggest that transanal TME could be a feasible, oncologically safe, and reproducible operation. However, more robust studies are required to assess the short- and long-term outcomes.
Reduced sleep spindles seem to play an important role as a possible mechanism or biomarker for impaired sleep-related memory consolidation in patients with schizophrenia, and are a new target for treatment to improve memory functions and clinical outcomes in these patients.
The DVD gives trusted information that patients cannot obtain or process from professional sources or the Internet. If used properly it can have a role in the decision making process, but should be seen within the context of other influences on the patient. This research has highlighted some aspects of the DVD that could be improved upon.
Our study indicates that a large proportion of men (48%) have an epididymal obstruction as the etiology for vasectomy reversal failure. We recommend that all surgeons offering vasectomy reversals be able to offer VE if required based on intraoperative findings to serve the patient adequately as well as his partner and their future fertility.
The development of Recovery oriented services requires a strong lived experience practitioner workforce, with appropriate resourcing and support available. The current medical model approach requires critique to facilitate reform and avoid tokenism.
This large-scale real-life patient cohort of primary stationary pacemaker implantation showed that gender has an impact onto pacemaker implantation, with less favourable outcomes for women.
Open nephron-sparing surgery for UCPCS should be taken into consideration for selected cases.
The frequency Ala allele (pro12Ala and Ala12Ala variant) was 28% in the whole group and 25% in the obese subjects. However the Pro12Ala polymorphism is quite common, it does not seem to be directly connected with onset of obesity. But it is interesting that the Ala allele is more frequent in non-obese women comparing to obese women (33 vs 20%). Reverse tendency was seen in men. Pro12Ala and/or Ala12Ala polymorphism is twice more frequent in obese subjects comparing to non-obese ones (38 vs 19%).
Prolonged mechanical ventilation, RDS and low gestational age were the major BPD determinants. Intrauterine smoke exposure seems to influence independently BPD development.
Postoperative infection neither conferred a protective effect, nor increased the risk of adverse oncologic outcomes after soft tissue sarcoma resection.
Our study suggests that there is no advantage in performing OCT routinely in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus without MDR. OCT did not show changes in retinal thickness in those patients compared to control. So OCT did not seem to be useful in the preclinical stages of diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, the conventional diagnostic methods are mandatory to detect early diabetic retinopathy.
MR imaging characteristics of hepatic hemangioma were similar in patients with normal compared to fibrotic and cirrhotic livers. Smaller lesion size was observed with liver disease and less T2 shine-through effect was seen in hemangiomas developed on cirrhosis, the latter being an important finding to highlight in these patients at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
Sperm autoimmunity is a plausible mechanism of infertility in men with germ cell tumors. Dendritic cells may induce antitumor cell cytotoxic reactions, but may also be cytotoxic to sperm cells or lead to inhibited spermatogenesis. Further studies focusing on tumor rejection antigen and the cloning of specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte against gametes are required to confirm these finding.
In obese patients, bariatric surgery significantly improves microalbuminuria and decreases the UACR and UPCR. Therefore, bariatric surgery should be considered as an early treatment for obesity with renal impairment and may prevent the progression to overt disease.
BHR at 10 years was a significant but modest predictor of active asthma 6 years later, with methacholine challenge being superior to exercise test.
On the basis of co-morbidity and familiality, OCD appears related both to anxiety disorders and to some conditions currently classified in other sections of DSM-IV.
These findings demonstrate dissimilar household incomes between NBDPS and census block group data. Caution should be used if block-level data is used as a proxy for individual-level household incomes in population-based birth defects surveillance and research.
The current findings may support proposed compensatory hypotheses involving redundant memory systems, up-regulation of neurotransmitters, or recruitment of other neural networks.
In pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, frequent episodes of preprandial hyperglycemia in the third trimester significantly impact the development of LGA infants.
No significant correlation between the histology of pterygium and recurrence rate could be established.
Magnetic endoscopic imager use improves patient comfort during colonoscopy but has not been shown to improve completion.
The results recommend this unique data source for continuous coverage. The data documentation should thus be further standardised and integrated into a complaint management system that includes all relevant complaint offices in Germany.
Initial performance with DBT among radiology residents and nonbreast imaging fellows is independent of years of training. Radiology educators should consider these findings when developing educational materials.
Single mothers compared to partnered mothers showed a different ability to cope with stress. However, only the coping strategy 'substance consumption' mediates the relationship between single motherhood and smoking. Exclusively in single mothers, 'self-blame/rumination' was associated with heavy smoking, indicating that they might utilize smoking as a way to come to terms with negative ruminative thoughts.
Navigated ultrasound is an important technical tool that helps in intraoperative orientation. Further prospective investigation is needed to assess the impact on GTR.
The role of the adenoids in pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion is beyond its histopathologic changes at least in the level of light microscopic findings.
The adequacy of haemodialysis is a predictor of improvement of cardiac autonomic nervous function in chronic uraemia. The same trend of improvement was seen also in CAPD patients.
We conclude that postconditioning does not enhance the protective effect of St Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia (under these strict experimental conditions); however, the efficacy of postconditioning correlates with the magnesium concentration of the cardioplegic solution, which may imply involvement of magnesium on mitochondria during ischaemia. There is a limited window of postconditioning protection dependent on the duration of the index ischaemia.
Despite major improvement in prognosis over time, breast cancer occurring among patients who are younger than 50 years remains a chronic disease that affects prognosis for decades.
This study suggests a relation between increased plasma VEGF levels and subsequent occurrence of microalbuminuria.
The introduction of Computer CPED may substantially contribute to the supply of CPED-courses in de first decade of the next century. By 2008 about 25% of the CPED-courses could be provided by computer education.
Cranio-cervical dissections are a frequent cause of stroke in childhood. Clinical suspicious related to cranio-cervical traumatisms and subsequent neurological symptoms should be high.
The high prevalence of dyslipidemia could justify lipid profile evaluation before prescribing a COC. BMI and smoking represent modest predictive markers for the presence of dyslipidemia in candidates for the use of combined oral contraceptives.
High CEC numbers were not specific to thyroid carcinoma. The methodology used here, based on a single measurement does not allow to identify severe forms of DTC, emphasizing the need of longitudinal measurements throughout therapy. Detection and characterization of tumour thyroid cells in circulation should be based on additional consideration of tissue-specific characteristics.
The laparoscopic approach is associated with a lower venous thromboembolism rate in comparison with open surgery, despite controlling for other variables. This additional benefit of the minimally invasive approach further supports its use, whenever feasible, for a variety of colorectal conditions.
Although risk of malignancy increases with size for all pheochromocytomas, size does not reliably predict malignancy in pheochromocytomas with local disease only. Regardless of tumor size, laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma should be converted to open adrenalectomy for difficult dissection, invasion, adhesions, or surgeon inexperience.
Off-pump coronary revascularization may offer risk reduction of neurological complications in patients with a significant carotid artery disease and a history of previous stroke, but a larger study population is needed to support this thesis. The growing discrepancy in long-term survival should draw attention to a more complete revascularization in OPCAB patients.
Active treatment policies accelerated platelet recovery in children with short-lasting ITP but did not avert the development of chronic ITP and did not cause a reduction in morbidity during follow-up.
Measurement error of self-report relative to the accelerometer appeared to be affected by intervention. Because measurement error cannot be definitively attributed to self-report or accelerometer, it would be prudent to measure both in future studies.
Laparoscopic bariatric procedures in superobese patients have been associated with significantly increased complications, including 30-day mortality, compared with morbidly obese patients. However, overall, the procedures appear to be safe, with low complication and 30-day mortality rates.
Most physicians do not take into account the prevalence of disease when interpreting a positive test result. This may cause unnecessary testing and diagnostic errors.
Oral supplementation of vitamin C is not associated with changes in markers of oxidation or endothelial activation in healthy male smokers.
Younger patients with OA are likely to return to high levels of activity after surgery, which may impact long-term wear-related implant survivorship. High activity levels are less common among younger patients with diagnoses other than OA. Age is not the ideal surrogate for activity level in patients considering THA; instead, specific activity-level measures should be used when discussing patient expectations pertaining to postoperative activity levels after arthroplasty.
Planned outpatient appointments after uncomplicated surgery seem to be neither necessary nor cost effective. A policy of "no planned follow up" results in no increase in primary care costs, and savings in hospital and patient costs. However, many patients expected and wanted to be seen again by their surgeon and GPs were concerned that a "no follow up" policy would result in an increase in workload.
The use of water resulted in better absorption of lidocaine and less impairment of the PaO2.
Among Brazilian women, exposure to intimate partner violence during pregnancy increases the chances of experiencing antenatal depressive symptoms.
ESWT accelerated the healing rate and improved cartilage and subchondral bone quality in the OCD rabbit model.
The RIPA may contribute to the blood supply of the liver in cirrhotic patients, especially those with portal venous thrombosis.
Having received religious education and prayer use were related to the presence of fewer MBRFs in European adults aged 50+ years. These lifestyle factors should be assessed as potential determinants of MBRFs adoption when examining chronic disease development in multicultural populations.
We showed that, in addition to its already demonstrated beneficial effects in in vivo models of cerebral ischemia, the potent PARP inhibitor PJ34 exerts in vitro an antiplatelet effect. Moreover, this is the first study to report that PJ34 could act via a competitive P2Y(12) antagonism. Thus, this antiplatelet effect could improve post-stroke reperfusion and/or prevent reocclusion, which reinforces the interest of this drug for stroke treatment.
Step count is an easily obtained and understood objective measure of daily physical activity. An exercise prescription that includes recommendations to gradually accumulate at least 5,000 additional steps per day may result in clinically significant improvements in outcomes relevant to patients with FM. Future studies are needed to elucidate the dose-response relationship between steps per day and patient outcomes in FM.
Since the principal risk factors for cryptorchidism are present in utero, the results of the current study strengthen the likelihood that the ethnic patterning of testicular cancer is at least partly due to prenatal risk factors.
Lymph node dissection for T1 sigmoid colon carcinoma should be limited to the root of the sigmoidal artery, and the inferior mesenteric artery should be preserved.
Biopsy must be considered according to its size and anatomic location of mesenchymal tumors. The invasive approach for every esophageal submucosal tumor is not necessary unless the size is very large, because most of them are benign in nature. However, the gastric submucosal tumor with more than 1 cm in diameter should be carefully and regularly followed up or biopsied because it cannot be assumed to be benign for any GIST more than 1 cm in size at the present time, safely.
This study confirms that there is a high rate of metachronous cancer for patients undergoing segmental resection for hereditary colon cancer. Quality of life following either segmental or extended resection is not significantly different. Consequently, it is reasonable to recommend extended surgery for most patients with high risk hereditary colon cancer.
The results of our study have shown that routine ureteral stent insertion has no impact on the rate of vesicoureteral leakage or obstruction in live-donor renal transplantation, whereas it is significantly associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract infection. Stenting should be limited to patients with a pathologic and/or defunctionalized bladder.
National guidance on these issues was found to be contentious and implementation was variable. Wide consultation with stakeholders is needed prior to the publication of revised guidance.
The AB Cognitive Screen (ABCS) can be administered in 3-5 min. The SMMSE and ABCS total and subtests significantly distinguished between dementia and MCI or NC. Verbal fluency and delayed recall were best at distinguishing between MCI and NC. The analysis illustrates how each subtest contributes to the sensitivity of the ABCS and suggests ways that sensitivity might be improved.
LigaSure does not safely seal small bowel.
Regardless of gender or mechanism of injury, the thoracic spine (T2-T10) is the most common region of fracture in pediatric trauma patients.
Although oral antibiotics modestly decreased the risk of serious bacterial infections in children with S pneumoniae occult bacteremia, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that oral antibiotics prevent meningitis. Published recommendations that oral antibiotics be administered to prevent serious bacterial infections in children with possible S pneumoniae occult bacteremia should be reevaluated in light of the lower risk of sequelae from S pneumoniae occult bacteremia and newer data concerning side effects from treatment.
FNAC empowered the diagnostic workup of patients with TM avoiding useless surgical approach. The low sensitivity of cytology might be reinforced by the application of ancillary techniques. In contrast with the reported predominant rate of kidney metastatic carcinomas, our findings underlined that intestinal cancer as well as lung and breast are the most common TM. TM are frequently multifocal and in a contest of a systemic disease so that a tailored therapy seems to be the best treatment.
Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed with a high rate of success, low morbidity, and low readmission rate. This protocol has withstood the test of time. Widespread adoption has the potential for substantial health care savings.
Exercise testing enhanced by cold air adds very little to a well designed respiratory questionnaire in community studies of asthma in childhood.
Bone marrow aspiration should not be a part of routine work-up for diagnosing ITP in children and should be reserved for those children having atypical clinical and laboratory features.
Our empirical results do not support the hypothesis of an overlap between the two concepts. Indeed bonding and EE measure the same object, i.e. the quality of family relationships, but time scales differ and so do the perspectives (patient vs. parental viewpoint).
Preventive healthcare services and chronic disease management are urgently needed by rural elders in China. NCMS should initiate payments to township health centers to enable them to undertake community outreach and education campaigns among rural residents, and train village doctors in standard chronic condition management and prevention, with prioritization of the provision of prevention and management of chronic conditions by village clinics.
T2 measurements of lumbar vertebra on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in evaluation of bone trabeculae in osteoporosis, and may also be helpful in differentiation of osteoporotic from normal, and osteopenic from osteoporotic patients.
Muscle fatigue resistance did not relate to the magnitude of the cardiovascular stress generated by isometric exercise of the same muscle in these patients.
Our data show that women undergoing TECABG have outcomes similar to those of men.
CD10 expression in our series seems to be associated to a small bowel origin of tumor. CD10 expression alone failed to reveal a statistically significant prognostic value. However survival analysis revealed worse prognosis in stomach tumours with mitotic count>10/50 HPF.
Definitive treatment of bronchial stenosis with self-expandable stents is a viable option. The 1st year seems to be the most crucial for determining definitive treatment, because no patients required removal of their stent after 1 year.
We found no beneficial effects of vaping at follow-up for either smoking cessation or smoking reduction.
Patients with infectious TB attend primary health care facilities, but are not recognised and diagnosed as cases. Health care staff should search actively within facilities for cases who attend the health care services to ensure that cases are not missed. Intensified case finding should start within the facility, and should not be limited to patients who report respiratory symptoms or who are human immunodeficiency virus positive.
Our retrospective cohort study of>3 million children found no association between varicella vaccine and ischemic stroke.
The results suggest that graduated driver licensing may have contributed to a reduction in young driver crashes, but the effects were minimal compared with those shown in many other graduated driver licensing evaluations.
The associations between neonatal risk factors and adverse outcome in our cohort were very similar to those found in other cohorts with another initial treatment of respiratory insufficiency. We found no significant adverse effects of mechanical ventilation beyond what could be explained by associations with chronic lung disease and IVH 3-4/PVL.
RLS is a frequent and treatable cause of disabling sleep disturbance in SCA3. This study provides evidence for the expanded CAG repeat in the SCA3 gene as a molecular factor causing RLS.
We conclude that MPA concentrations determined by the CEDIA assay showed significant positive bias compared to HPLC-UV method. Therefore, caution must be exercised in interpreting therapeutic drug monitoring result of MPA if CEDIA assay is used.
Of the many factors that may influence postoperative pain, chronic sleeping difficulties emerge in this population of patients as the strongest determinant of pain at rest. Intraperitoneal surgery and having a relative with a history of pain are the strongest determinants of pain during cough/mobilization. These findings make physiological sense and deserve more attention by anesthesiologists.
The changes seen after urethral instrumentation represent no more than the biological intra-individual variation normally seen in pressure-flow studies and do not lead to a clinically significant change in obstruction class.
We conclude that adolescents with affective disturbance who have gained weight on neuroleptic drugs may benefit from topiramate in terms of mood stabilization and body weight control.
Self-reported suicidal behavior and ideation among drug addicts is highly prevalent and more so with increasing number of areas of childhood adversities.
Our results show a correlation between patient satisfaction and the mHHS but also demonstrate a limitation of the mHHS as an outcome measure in the prediction of patient satisfaction. Further investigation is required to assess factors beyond current standard orthopaedic clinical outcome measures that may influence patient satisfaction after hip arthroscopy.
Improved overall survival is associated with pediatric trauma patients treated at ATC-AQ.
Over 50% of all colorectal cancer specimens contain fewer than 12 lymph nodes despite clear national guidelines. This is of particular importance to Dukes B cancers where over 53% of cases may be understaged and not offered adjuvant therapy. Significant variation exists between hospitals within the same region.
Patients who had adjuvant surgery had significant improvement of survival without increase in morbidity and mortality, relative to patients with locally advanced disease. Thus, adjuvant surgery may provide the promising results in this group who responded favorably to initial chemo(radio)therapy in unresectable pancreatic cancer.
This study supports the hypothesis that oxidised LDL are capable of triggering the transition from sentinel to messenger DC. Furthermore, the DC clustering-activation-apoptosis sequence in the presence of different LDL forms is consistent with a regulatory DC role in immunopathogenesis of atheroma. A sequence of initial accumulation of DC, increasing LDL oxidation, and DC-induced T cell activation, may explain why local breach of tolerance can occur. Above a threshold level, however, supervening DC apoptosis limits this, contributing instead to the central plaque core.
there was no justification for claiming that long waiting lists for tonsillectomy are frequently associated with resolution of recurrent acute tonsillitis.
Our finding associating CoC THA bearings with a lower risk of infection after THA must be considered very preliminary, and we caution readers against attributing all of the observed difference to the bearing surface. It is possible that some or all of the observed difference associated with bearing type may have been driven by other factors such as ASA and BMI, which could not be included in our multivariate analysis, and so future registry studies on this topic must assess those variables carefully.
Patients with asthma and/or allergies are more likely to experience delayed surgical intervention versus other patients. Overall, patients with delayed surgery reported less improvement in SNOT-22 scores than patients treated at earlier time points, regardless of co-morbid status. Delaying surgical intervention may worsen long term clinical outcomes.
Together, these findings suggest that spending money on others shapes cardiovascular health, thereby providing a pathway by which prosocial behavior improves physical health among at-risk older adults. (PsycINFO Database Record
Overall, women with NAC-PM had better body image and sexual functioning compared with women with SS-PM, while both groups had comparable levels of cancer-related distress and perception of breast cancer risk.
Patients treated for solid tumors have reduced bone mass. Low BMI and local irradiation seem to be the factors responsible for reduced BMD in children treated for ST. The use of steroids does not disturb bone mass accumulation in patients treated for childhood malignancies. However, a long-term effect of cancer treatment on osteoporosis risk remains to be determined.
Women with a sibling history of diabetes were more likely to have hGDM than women with other family history patterns.
The subjects trained in individual endurance sports such as triathlon, biking, and road running have a lower DCI than subjects trained in team sports such as volley ball, handball, or basketball. This survey, performed on a large population, does indicate that for half of them daily calcium intake is below the threshold of 1,000 mg x d(-1) considered the daily requirement covering the needs of a population without age or gender distinction and that calcium intake is not related to the level of physical activity.
The metabolic syndrome and an increased waist-to-hip ratio are independently associated with a decreased International Index of Erectile Function-5 score. The metabolic syndrome in men older than 50 years is significantly associated with a higher proportion of moderate to severe erectile dysfunction.
Although a retrospective review has limitations, it would appear that adequate surgical staging and adjuvant chemotherapy confer no benefit in terms of survival in Stage I disease.
A fetal ultrasound OD/AC ratio ≥0.26 is associated with increased postnatal morbidity and mortality.
In patients without parietal pleural injury, thoracoabdominal radical nephrectomy without the placement of a thoracostomy tube can be performed safely and effectively, with a low risk of postoperative complications and a decrease in the overall hospital stay and hospital charges.
The overall rate of ulnar nerve symptoms after elbow contracture release was low if ulnar nerve decompression was performed in patients with preoperative symptoms or a positive Tinel test. There was a higher rate of ulnar nerve symptoms in patients with more severe contractures (≤ 100° of preoperative flexion), which did not reach statistical significance.
The technique of intraoperative neuromonitoring in thyroid surgery is safe and reliable in excluding postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy; it has high accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and negative predictive value. Neuromonitoring is useful to identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve and it can be a useful adjunctive technique for reassuring surgeons of the functional integrity of the nerve but it does not decrease the incidence of injuries compared with visualization alone. Its application can be particularly recommended for high-risk thyroidectomies.
A neonatal variant of the Dubin-Johnson syndrome may account for the unusual findings in these infants.
Unopened loop colostomy offers the advantages of protection of a colorectal anastomosis without proper morbidity or mortality, shorter hospitalization, and improved psychological comfort for the patient. It's principal indication is to minimize the risks related to leakage from an at-risk colorectal anastomosis.
In 2010-2012 in Britain, the proportion of young adults reporting chlamydia testing was generally higher in those reporting factors associated with chlamydia. However, many of those with risk factors had not been recently tested, leaving potential for undiagnosed infections. Greater screening and prevention efforts among individuals in deprived areas and those reporting risk factors for chlamydia may reduce undiagnosed prevalence and transmission.
: Comparisons of mTBI rates should take account of length of deployment when based on last deployment. Doing so reduces but does not eliminate the differences between UK and US forces.
There are significant differences in the proportion of bilateral (compared to unilateral) losses and in the rates and severity profile of hearing loss among young Maori when compared with their NZ European peers. This has implications for screening and other hearing services in NZ.
With this technique common ventral spinal trauma can be readily recreated. Magnetic resonance imaging allows early detection of edematous changes in experimental spinal cord injuries in the rat.
The weak associations we have demonstrated between weight and length at birth and risk of caries at age 61 months cannot be considered causal, however, the relationship between the two variables warrants further investigation.
We think that routine level IV dissection is not necessary in the management of clinically and radiologically N0 necks in patients with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.
The results of the CMEDF are very promising. However, a much larger patient series from multicenter studies is still required for drawing up a final conclusion.
Maintaining the IP over 12 mm Hg for 8 wk caused increased oxidative damage to both lipids and proteins with an increased pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance. In an attempt to compensate for this damage the muscle fibers increased their glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activity.
New York's mandated limitations on residents' work hours do not appear to have positively or negatively affected in-hospital mortality from congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or pneumonia in teaching hospitals.
There are no gender-related differences in patients admitted with acute strokes. A minor trend for higher acute-phase mortality in females may be due to their less frequent lacunar strokes and less frequent use of aspirin prior to stroke. Men and women with acute strokes should have access to similar services.
No significant improvement was found in the mean points of the total group. In the second year, only 16.4 of the instructors were affected positively.
In our population, maternal height has an influence on gestational length, and the lower three quartiles was associated with increased odds of labour at>32 to<37 weeks. This effect should be taken into consideration in the adoption of international recommendations in obstetric management and intervention.
Even after controlling for health and severity of disability, the coefficients for smoking and income were significant, exceeding that reported previously within the general population. The importance of these factors may be magnified after severe disability, even though life expectancy is already greatly diminished in this population.
The findings lend support to the notion that the addition of repeated personalised feedback improves outcome from guided CBT self-help treatment and deserves further study.
The null hypothesis was rejected. The extraction of upper premolars rather than nonextraction decreased the pharyngeal airway space more in patients with mandibular prognathism who planned to have bimaxillary surgery.
The JDC and JDCS models contribute differently to workers mental health, depending on the instrument used to measure mental health. Implications for workplace health interventions are discussed.
Elderly patients who undergo LAP have a significantly shorter LOS and fewer complications compared to elderly patients who undergo OP. Laparoscopy should be considered in all patients in whom ileo-colic or sigmoid resection is planned regardless of age.
Provision of OTC statins to US adults at low or moderate risk of CHD would have a greater impact on CHD prevention than providing prescription statins for those at high risk of CHD. Provision of OTC statins alongside lifestyle interventions among those at low or moderate risk of CHD could substantially reduce the number of CHD events in the population.
Small to moderate amounts of blood in the toilet bowl are subjectively significantly overestimated, whereas larger volumes tend to be underestimated. This may have implications for the management of patients presenting with rectal bleeding.
Our study demonstrates that blood culture yield is lower at the weekend. This is likely caused by delays or errors in incubation and processing, reflecting the reduced provision of support services at the weekend. Reorganization of services to address the "weekend effect" should acknowledge the interdependent nature of healthcare service delivery.
EF problems in everyday life were important predictors of depression. Researchers and clinicians should consistently assess for the ADHD-depression comorbidity. Clinicians should consider incorporating strategies to address EF deficits when treating people with depression.
The current results suggest that LR may be responsible for an increase in DM and disease specific mortality in patients who undergo CS and receive RT. This suggestion is reinforced by the distinct difference seen in the time distribution of DM after LR developed and by the fact that recurrent disease that originated outside of the surgical bed did not affect OS. These data reinforce the necessity to insure optimal LC in patients who are treated with breast-conserving therapy.
These findings suggest that women with low body mass tend to have low hip BMD and those with high mass tend to have high BMD. Controlling for the potential mediating variables did not influence the dose-response relationship between mass and BMD. It appears that lifestyle may not influence the body mass and BMD relationship, making it a challenge for women with low mass to avoid risk of low BMD.
For patients not readmitted within 30 days, follow-up within 30 days appeared to be beneficial on the basis of subsequent service utilization.
Penta stent appears to offer a better deployment and a larger MLD post-PCI than Carbofilm-coated stent. However, a thicker NIH was observed on Penta stent at 6-month follow-up, when compared to Tecnic.
among the middle-aged and elderly women and men, a light alcohol intake is associated with lower mortality than abstention or heavy drinking.
These findings support the notion that accumulating short spurts of MVPA protects against the development of hypertension but not obesity in middle-age adults.
On the MDCT scanners investigated, when dose modulation is combined with fast tube rotation times, tube current saturation occurs with weaker x-ray tubes resulting in deterioration of image quality.
vCDI is not applicable in ophthalmology at present.
Patients with ovarian cancer with MMRD after primary surgery obtain a modest but significant advantage in survival (10 months) over suboptimal patients. Patients with macroscopic residual disease (0.1-0.5 cm) obtain a better survival (53 months) than those with more than 0.5 to 1 cm. We propose that they should be classified as a different prognostic group.
highlighting the sexual transmissibility of HPV does not seem to lower vaccination intentions or behaviors among young women. Potential challenges for promotion of the HPV vaccination program in Australia and worldwide are discussed.
Both nodal motion and the varying distance between the carina and nodal position may explain the lower diagnostic yields for TBNA procedures performed without real-time guidance.
If both BPD and LMP are available, BPD should be used to predict term. If only LMP is available, term should be calculated as the first date of the LMP plus 282.
Patients with rectal cancer and unresectable distant metastases can be successfully palliated by resection of the primary tumour with low morbidity and mortality. The early involvement of a palliative care team facilitates patient management and helps patients enjoy what remains of the rest of their lives at home, in comfort and with good symptom control.
Although surgery chairs and deans espouse similar core leadership values, deans believe that a healthier leadership climate exists in their institutions than their surgery chairs do. The study findings suggest that tighter leadership alignment between deans and surgery chairs may predict a higher level of institutional performance in the clinical and academic arenas.
The results suggest that failure to report pain does not appear to be associated with the age of the patient in itself, but with type of pain and clinical context. Both patients and physicians should be encouraged to actively address pain management. Further research is needed.
Public campaigns and initiatives for increasing physical activity in the working population should target everybody, irrespective of physical activity at work.
These findings suggest that PLC is a distinct clinical entity that presents at a more advanced stage and may require more aggressive surgical and adjuvant treatment.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate preoperative predictors for surgical success in patients undergoing sphincterotomy. Although urodynamic evaluation is strongly advised prior to surgery in patients with spinal cord lesions, it improves prediction of success only marginally.
Abnormal P wave morphology significantly predicted new AF and 90-day mortality in STEMI patients.
The results suggest that stabilizing selection does not limit variability in the female pelvic canal. Biological plasticity may be greater in the canal than that in other skeletal regions.
Genotyping at diagnosis identifies patients with a homozygous mutant TPMT and may prevent severe and life-threatening toxicity. ALL treatment monitoring should preferentially be based on repeated determinations of intracellular active metabolites (6-TGN) and methylated metabolites.
Although a trend toward a more backward inclination of the spine and individual vertebrae might pre-exist during the ascending phase or peak of pubertal growth, the differences become more significant during the late stage of puberty. The observation could be related to relatively active anterior vertebral overgrowth that occurs in females during pubertal growth.
A packaged human immunodeficiency virus prevention intervention can be delivered by agencies, with benefits similar to those achieved in the research setting.
Data suggest that the SFC is a cost-effective school-based intervention.
I-MIBG hybrid SPECT-CT shows high sensitivity and specificity for characterizing adrenal lesions in patients with clinical or biochemical suspicion of pheochromocytoma and is superior to PS and SPECT alone. It will be especially useful in countries where (123)I-MIBG is not available.
A parachute is an effective tool to prevent major trauma when falling from a great height.
CI was associated with myocardial ischemia. Higher rates of hard events and revascularization were observed in patients with CI, in accordance with the larger extent of myocardial ischemia found in these patients. Performing MPS in the setting of CI may maintain the diagnostic and prognostic abilities of the test.
These findings suggest that routine pretransfusion testing in cesarean patients can be omitted.
ART provided in the continuation phase of TB treatment does not have a significant impact on reducing case fatality. Reasons for this and possible measures to reduce high case fatality in the initial phase of TB treatment are discussed.
Term and preterm children had similarly elevated scores on the Bayley III calculated Cognitive score compared to the previous Bayley II MDI score. The use of a conversion algorithm may be helpful in studies that used both Bayley editions to get comparable outcome measurements within a clinical or research paradigm.
Five years after 1st delivery stress incontinent women seem to recall the onset of the symptom imprecisely.
The benign clinical course, lack of mass effect, and minimal or no T2 prolongation argue against neoplasm and instead indicate a vascular cause. We suspect the decreased signal on gradient-echo sequences represents elevated intravascular deoxyhemoglobin from stagnant blood flow. The findings are atypical for cavernous angioma or classic venous malformation. Although pathologic confirmation is lacking, the radiographic features are most consistent with capillary telangiectasia or a transitional capillary-venous malformation. Despite the absence of progression or hemorrhage in any of the patients to date, the long-term prognosis currently is unknown. We emphasize the importance of recognizing the nonneoplastic nature of these lesions.
Considerable segments of respondents had fixed preferences for either treatment option. Applying latent class analysis was essential in quantifying preferences for attributes of early assisted discharge.
In patients with high-grade renal trauma under conservative treatment, notification of hemodynamic and vital signs instability and laboratory data are more important than the results of reimaging CT scan. Reimaging CT is not accurately able to predict the failure of conservative treatment.
A positive anastomotic biopsy did not predict an improved outcome after radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy. Anastomotic biopsy was associated with a longer time to salvage radiotherapy. However, this delay did not translate into worse disease-free outcomes in patients who underwent anastomotic biopsy. High pre-radiotherapy PSA greater than 1 ng./ml. was the most significant predictor of biochemical failure after therapeutic radiotherapy. Decisions regarding local radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy may be made without documenting recurrent local disease.
Elderly patients are significantly underrepresented in these recent key practice-defining trials. Greater representation of elderly patients in phase III trials is required to better define evidence-based treatment paradigms in the increasingly elderly NSCLC population.
Presentations at EGPRN meetings commonly concern research ideas or ongoing research. In this light, the ratio of published work to presented work compares well with the corresponding ratios found for international meetings in other specialist fields. This survey was also meant as an audit of the EGPRN meetings and gives better insight in needs for future strategy.
These findings suggest that in these patients, coronary spasm may have been induced by arterial hyperreactivity because of local inflammation in the coronary arterial wall and that the corticosteroids suppressed the arterial hyperreactivity by alleviating the inflammation. Corticosteroids may be considered as a treatment choice for patients with refractory vasospastic angina, particularly when the patient has an allergic tendency, such as bronchial asthma.
In patients with clearly documented arrhythmogenic PVs, the SePVI of the PV triggering the AF or an ipsilateral PV had a comparable long-term success rate and shorter RF energy delivery and procedure times than the EmPVI.
Dysphagia in spinal muscular atrophy type II is due to a neurologic dysfunction (lower motor neuron problems from the cranial nerves in the brainstem) influencing the muscle force and efficiency of movement of the tongue and the submental muscle group in combination with a biomechanical component (compensatory head posture). The results suggest an integrated treatment with an adapted posture during meals and the advice of drinking water after meals to prevent aspiration pneumonias.
The allegation of malpractice related to dentistry for children is a very small portion of both dental and general health malpractice in the United States.
Use of low-dose NSBB medication in patients with liver cirrhosis is not indicated in terms of overall and HCC-free survival.
Treatment alteration rarely results from empiric CT imaging in the early days of prolonged FN. We therefore recommend limiting initial empiric CT imaging to the chest only in patients without localizing signs or symptoms and prolonged FN.
In selected cases, renal biopsy performed by an expert practitioner as an outpatient procedure is safe and does not require 24-hour observation.
Our data suggest that prolactin levels are associated with VT in a dose-dependent fashion. Future studies are needed to evaluate the causality of this relationship.
The results of this study suggest that the lack of p16 function could happen in advanced stage of SG tumors.
More than 70% of our healthy subjects showed pathological urodynamic findings. Although UDI is the gold standard to assess refractory LUTS, it seems not to be applicable in healthy subjects to define normal lower urinary tract function. Therefore, we do not recommend using UDI to select healthy control subjects.
Patient satisfaction and continence parameters improved after cuff downsizing. We believe that this technique is a simple and effective method of restoring continence after urethral atrophy.
Bone SPECT may be comparable with MR imaging for differentiating malignant from benign VCFs, especially, in the case of VCFs with a complete replacement of the normal fatty marrow.
In this group of older men and women, drinking more than seven drinks per week was associated with impairments in IADLs and, to a lesser extent, AADLs. Drinking more than three drinks per occasion was associated with impairments in IADLs.
Caffeine intake in the range consumed by young adult women is not an important risk factor for low BMD.
Both types of assay gave an identical estimate of thyroid function in every single patient. Use of the LUMI did not give additional information leading to a change in patient management. Therefore, TSH measurement using IRMA does still meet today's routine clinical requirements.
The results of the present study revealed that the 24-hour urinary calcium cannot be used as a surrogate marker for dietary intake of calcium. A detailed dietary history is needed for all women with recurrent stone formation for proper assessment and potential modification of calcium intake to reduce recurrences.
Role discrepancy cannot be resolved by having more clinical experience. While clinical experience enhances nurses' conceptions of their ideal roles, it can also lead to role discrepancy if there are organizational barriers that prevent nurses from engaging in their ideal roles. It is important to find a way whereby nurses can actualize their ideal views of practice in the current healthcare environment.
The incidence of gynaecological infection after surgical, expectant, and medical management of first trimester miscarriage is low (2-3%), and no evidence exists of a difference by the method of management. However, significantly more unplanned admissions and unplanned surgical curettage occurred after expectant management and medical management than after surgical management.
In our experience, AFP was the strongest predictor of HCC recurrence, stronger than tumor morphology. AFP could ameliorate the selection of LT candidates. Further studies to evaluate the combination of morphological and biological criteria are needed.
We find no systematic indication that the level of inclusivity improves key future outcomes. Research on educational and functional outcomes for children with autism can benefit from data on large samples of children educated in real-world settings, such as the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2, but more nuanced indicators should be developed to measure the quality of special education for children with autism.
There were high levels of endorsement of the Asthma Management Plan for children with asthma.
By lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria from 6 to 5 points, we were able to identify 15% more RA patients at the cost of 8% more false-positive patients.
A significant number of children require brief hospitalisation for relatively minor illness, but unnecessary delays caused by administrative aspects of hospital admission and relatively infrequent inpatient review by medical staff often lengthen the period of admission. Significant cost savings are possible with the use of a short stay facility, and a large number of patients are suitable for this form of care.
Nephroureterectomy with BCE remains the standard of care in the treatment of UC of the renal pelvis and should invariably be performed in patients with locally advanced disease. Conversely, patients with pT1 and pT2 disease could be considered for NU without compromising CSM. However, recurrence data are needed to fully confirm the validity of this option.
We report on the cases of 2 patients with CAA who presented with epileptic seizure and were found to have a restricted subarachnoid hematoma in the cerebral sulcus on MRI before their subcortical hemorrhages occurred. Both cases were diagnosed pathologically. This demonstrated that vessel ruptures in CAA can occur in the subarachnoid space, particularly the cerebral sulci, as a result of ruptures of meningeal arteries. A restricted SAH on CT/MRI could be a warning sign of a huge subcortical hemorrhage in CAA.
Although most residents are adequately exposed to surveillance strategies for SRMs, only 54% participated in an ablative procedure. Nonetheless, almost 50% of residents recommended ablation to manage SRMs in the aging, comorbid patient. This suggests a disconnect between training and future practice pattern.
Contact between a foreign body and the peritoneum is required to induce bacterial translocation.
We conclude that a PRO is a helpful tool for systematic monitoring HRQOL of children with cancer, without lengthening the duration of the consultation. It is recommended to be implemented in clinical practice.
There is low-grade evidence from 3 published studies that postsurgical sagittal imbalance may increase the risk for cervical radiological ASP.
These findings suggest that the overexpression of PDGF isoforms and receptors may play a crucial role in the development of thyroid nodules and recurrent goitre.
While it is recognised that publication date might proxy for unobserved covariates, the possibility of a learning effect in favour of ICSI is not supported by the meta-regression.
A rigidly applied protocol and strict adherence to sterile technique can reduce shunt infections to a very low level.
The survival of resurfacing arthroplasty appears comparable to THA in posttraumatic osteoarthritis and for resurfacing in patients with osteoarthritis. Therefore, resurfacing may present an alternative treatment to THA in these patients.
PTX may be useful as a coadjuvant drug with interferon during the first three months of treatment since some of the side effects of interferon may thus be reduced. However, there seems no justification for using PTX for a longer period since there is no functional improvement.
The study provides some evidence that a large number of the patients may not be well informed about the specific role of BenzhexoI in their treatment and that that some of their assumptions may portend danger for their health and outcome. Health workers may also have neglected to educate them. There is a need to intensify patient education in our clinics.
Perceived risk of osteoporosis may lead to decreased physical activity and hence actually increase the risk. When informing individuals about health risk people's images and imaginations of the actual risk have to be acknowledged. When a bone scan is being considered, explicit advice encouraging physical activity - especially the weight-bearing kind - should be stressed.
These results demonstrated that intramuscular glutamine was spared when glucose was added to glutamine supplementation in adult rats. Consequently, the role of glucose consisted in slowing down the glutamine synthesis. By contrast, glucose has no role when it was associated with glycine whose degradation does not produce energy.
A comparable recurrence rate is attainable with a VATS approach once  the learning curve is surpassed and a reduction in morbidity is an additional merit.
The findings of our study, in contrast to the findings of other reported studies, demonstrate that obesity does not affect the success rate of US in the visualization of the inflamed appendix in children.
The irradiated area of the mediastinum is one of the significant factors in radiation induced lung injury.
Oxybutynin does not add to the clinical effectiveness of PV in the majority of nursing home residents with urge type urinary incontinence. Selected residents may, however, become more responsive to PV while on oxybutynin. Our data are consistent with other studies of bladder relaxant medications in functionally impaired populations. New drugs and/or other interventions are needed for the large number of incontinent nursing home residents who do not respond well to PV.
Age does not certainly affect recurrence in patients with bladder cancer treated with bacille Calmette-Guérin therapy. The related side effects in the elderly patients were almost equal to those in the younger. With careful monitoring, bacille Calmette-Guérin therapy is safe even in elderly patients.
No evidence was found that increasing management inputs was associated with improved productivity. On the contrary, spending more on top level managers appeared in fact to be associated with lower productivity levels. Results would thus appear to be in line with decisions to reduce the level of expenditure on management in NHS hospitals. Quality differences could not be measured, however, and it is possible that management input is associated with quality improvements which might reduce or reverse observed productivity losses.
The large increases in MVC and MEP suggest that regular use of a foot-drop stimulator strengthens activation of motor cortical areas and their residual descending connections, which may explain the therapeutic effect on walking speed.
A high degree of interstitial atrial fibrosis indicates a high degree of spatial heterogeneity of interstitial collagen. Although serum PICP is known to be correlated with ventricular fibrosis, this and other serum markers of collagen turnover (PINP, PIIINP, and ICTP) do not directly reflect atrial fibrosis in patients with severe cardiac disease.
This investigation found evidence that while eating patterns clearly contribute to daily energy intake on weekdays and weekends, they may not necessarily contribute to weight change. At the end of the day, what may be most important is regular self-monitoring and total caloric intake on both the weekdays and weekends.
Current evidence cannot support an exact anti-obesity role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in overweight/obese subjects. However, these subjects may benefit from reducing abdominal fat with fish oil supplementation especially when combined with life modification intervention. Further large-scale and long-term clinical trials are needed to gain definite conclusions.
Structural-level policy changes needed to transform community-based pharmacy settings to patient-centered medical homes include recognizing pharmacists as important players in the multidisciplinary health care team, extending the health information exchange highway to include pharmacist-generated electronic therapeutic records, and realigning financial incentives. Comprehensive policy initiatives are needed to optimize the use of highly trained pharmacists in enhancing the quality of health care to an ever-growing number of Americans with chronic conditions who access care in community-based pharmacy settings.
Total arterial revascularization with composite T-grafts can be performed safely by surgeons with different surgical experience. Despite differences in surgical performance parameters (e.g. operation times, blood transfusions), complication rates were extremely low, irrespective of the surgeon's operative experience. Surgeons can be introduced to these procedures in an early phase of training.
NE was present in about one fourth of children with OSAS undergoing surgery, and resolved in about half. Lower response rate was associated with prematurity, obesity, family history of NE, presence of non-monosymptomatic NE, severe NE preoperatively, and arousal difficulties.
Children with CH treated early in life due to newborn screening may have reduced IQ relative to siblings.
The relative lack of colonization of the cleft nasal floor by oral bacteria may reflect poor transmission of bacteria through the fistula, competition with commensal nasal flora, or an inability of oral bacteria to survive in a saliva-depleted area. The investigation is not helpful in the assessment of oronasal fistulae in the clinic.
Short- and mid-term outcomes and complication rates following microscopic ACDF(I) were comparable for patients operated on by supervised neurosurgical residents or by senior surgeons. Our data thus indicate that a structured neurosurgical education of operative skills does not lead to worse outcomes or increase the complication rates after ACDF(I). Confirmation of the results by a prospective study is desired.
The dysfunction requirement appears to reflect a widely shared lay and professional concept of disorder.
The results of the study are consistent with the view that risk factors may influence postnatal depression indirectly through at least two distinct cognitive mediators (dysfunctional maternal and general cognitions). It may be possible to target therapies more effectively by identifying the relevant mediating mechanism(s) for individuals with different risk profiles.
Use of an e-learning package in immunology in addition to regular teaching improved learning outcomes for intermediate-range students.
It is necessary to have further randomized controlled trials to better define the indication of Foot orthotics (severity of knee OA, genu varum), test the efficacy of other orthoses such as cushioning FO. The long-term side effects, mainly on the external femorotibial compartment could also be assessed. A medical and economical assessment of FO prescriptions is also quite necessary.
In a population of veterans with comorbid diabetes and SMI, patients on average had good glucose control and medication adherence regardless of where they received primary care.
Macroeconomic improvements, measured by unemployment, only marginally contributed to the Black PT-LBW trend in the 1990s. To effect further reductions, future studies should investigate other possible determinants of the proximate behavioral changes that did explain the trend (e.g., Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, increased, cigarette taxes/smoking legislation).
These data demonstrate that Australia has two distinct patterns of infectious syphilis: a substantially declining occurrence in Indigenous remote communities and an increasing incidence in males residing in urban and regional areas. Given the decline in notification rates in Indigenous remote communities, now might be the right time to move toward eliminating infectious syphilis from Indigenous communities.
These data confirm that patients who have a positive sentinel node biopsy and do not undergo CALND have a lower risk profile for axillary disease. In this lower risk subset, axillary treatment may not be necessary.
Results of our analysis provide a national perspective on data linkage practices in the US. Our findings can be used to promote further data linkages, facilitate sharing of data and linkage methodologies, and identify uses of the resulting linked data.
Both aging (with not excluded cardiovascular risk factors) and mild hypertension are associated with elevated rPWV. rPWV increases to a similar extent both in young mildly hypertensive subjects and in aged anamnestically healthy persons. Healthy aging is not associated with increased rPWV.
The single-item measure is a valid screening tool to determine whether respondents are sufficiently active to benefit their health.
Routine sedation before diagnostic and therapeutic injections is not necessary as the majority of patients would not request sedation before the procedure when given the option. However, in some patients sedation is indicated, and all patients would benefit from educational material on sedation before the injection.
A uniquely high percentage of upper-level disc herniations develop in NFL athletes, and although CDH injuries present career threatening implications, an upper-level CDH does not preclude a player from successfully returning to play at a competitive level. In fact, these athletes showed comparable postsurgical performance to those athletes who underwent CDH procedures at lower cervical levels.
Previous early and repeated exposure to antibiotics may predispose individuals to develop JIA. Alternatively, the apparent association may reflect shared susceptibility to infections and JIA.
Outpatient angioplasty is feasible and, according to the retrospective analysis of the authors' admittedly incomplete data, safe. The use of stents facilitates same-day discharge. Pre-, per- and postprocedural triage allows identification of high risk patients for a longer observation period with or without additional treatment.
The proportion of both women and gastric ulcers was higher among German patients, while Eastern European patients underwent more definitive operations. German patients experienced more general complications and a higher mortality. Complications were related to high age and delayed admission.
The observed effects were detected at contaminant levels within occupational exposure standards, so further reductions are required, particularly in SO(2) exposures.
Hospital discharge data in Québec are, in general, reliably coded and compare favourably with clinical medical record review in their ability to predict mortality. It appears sufficiently reliable to provide useful information about clinical outcomes of cardiac care and to identify problems that warrant investigation.
Despite reported cases in the literature, we found that the risk of severe eye injury from airbags was very low (0.4%) in fatal or relatively serious accidents. Eyewear did not seem to increase this risk but might interfere with the injury pattern.
The expression patterns of the selected molecular biomarkers of the immune system are promising to reflect the health and immune status of the harbour porpoise under different levels of stress.
In this department an average of 15% of coded SHOs working time was spent performing administrative and technical tasks, rising to 17% of coded time during a night shift. This is equivalent to an average time of 78 minutes per 10 hour shift/SHO. Most tasks included in these categories could be performed by PAs thus potentially decreasing patient waiting times, improving risk management, allowing doctors to spend more time with their patients, and possibly improving doctors' training.
Rural geographic location of teaching site, but not primary care specialty, was associated with higher student satisfaction. However, higher student satisfaction ratings did not correspond to better student performance. Provided that all sites meet the screening criteria for inclusion in a teaching program, these findings support the continued development of high-quality, heterogeneous, interdisciplinary, primary care experiences.
The prognosis for patients with ductal adenocarcinoma in the distal pancreas who were treated with potentially curative distal pancreatectomy is poor; however, the results are not substantially different from those reported after pancreaticoduodenectomy for malignant tumors of the proximal pancreas. Some patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal pancreas who were treated with resection may be long-term survivors. We recommend resection of carcinoma of the distal pancreas when the disease is limited to the gland and believe that all patients with ductal adenocarcinoma should be considered for postoperative adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy.
In our PRES cohort, we found relevant clinicoradiological differences between pediatric and adult PRES patients. However, prospective studies are warranted to establish factors that are specifically associated with pediatric PRES.
The clinical and imaging findings significantly associated with sternoclavicular joint infection included joint capsule distention of 10 mm or greater, extension over both the clavicle and sternum, adjacent fluid signal bone marrow replacement, elevated Westergren red blood cell sedimentation rate, and fever.
The results of this study support the idea of the familial nature of cognitive styles in AN. The implications of these findings are discussed.
Outcomes including functional results and pouch failure rates for patients developing a leak after stapled anastomosis at ileal pouch-anal anastomosis were significantly better than outcomes for patients who develop a leak after handsewn anastomosis.
Categorical and dimensional representations of psychosis are complementary. Using both appears to be a promising strategy in conceptualising psychotic illnesses.
Sampling site does not influence levels of fT4 and TSH.
The prognosis of individuals with CTD-PF appears to be significantly better than those with IPF-CS, but remains an important cause of death in patients with connective tissue disease, and requires more effective treatment options.
A pressure ulcer prevention programme for nursing homes, which was feasible and acceptable, with positive impact and outcome in a nursing home was empirically developed.
There is potential for combining A4R and PBMA in a more comprehensive approach to priority setting, which uses a fair priority-setting process to reach decisions aimed at achieving optimal benefits with available resources.
Low-risk BCCs suitable for excision by GP surgeons are of low prevalence and it would be difficult for GPs to maintain competencies in BCC surgery. Dermatologists should continue to provide the lead in skin cancer diagnosis, treatment and management.
These data suggest that the neighbourhood environment may influence blood pressure; only part of the associations between contextual factors and blood pressure may operate through body weight and body shape modification.
The EPIC FFQ seems adequate to correctly classify low, medium and high consumers and might therefore be used to identify adolescent population groups at risk or for differences between populations. However, agreement between the EPIC FFQ and the 7-day WDR was very poor on both a group and an individual basis, and demonstrates that the EPIC FFQ is not an appropriate method for estimating absolute intakes in this age group.
Close follow-up visits for at least 2 years are important to detect recurrent disease in groin and pelvic lymph nodes. Treatment of recurrent groin metastases should no longer be considered as a palliative situation--given that one half of the patients will have long-term survival after multimodal treatment strategies.
This study does not confirm the hypothesis that hot-burning sensations are produced by the axonal damage of afferent amyelinated fibres in peripheral nerves. It agrees with clinical evidence suggesting that patients with different clinical conditions can complain of hot-burning sensations, independently of the presence of a nerve lesion.
In a limited number of patients (n = 34), gabexate mesylate (2 mg/kg/hr) could not inhibit coagulation or fibrinolysis and gabexate mesylate could not improve the DIC score or mortality rate in pre- or mild DIC.
Satisfaction with perceived limb alignment appears to influence outcome after TKA and is not reflected in current outcome scales. Perhaps patients should be counselled on how alignment is restored and on what to expect of their limb alignment and appearance after TKA.
The mid-head resection technique can circumvent the need for a more invasive procedure such as standard THA in patients who would benefit from a conservative arthroplasty but do not possess good femoral head bone quality or morphology.
This study helps to inform referral of pregnant women with a fetus who has IVM for prenatal MRI.
MRI does not accurately predict extent of disease in patients with extensive DCIS. In patients with MRI tumor size<or = 2 cm, MRI may assist in surgical planning. MRI results in patients with DCIS should be interpreted with caution; decision for mastectomy should not be made on MRI findings alone.
M-CBT aimed at reinforcing acute treatment gains to prevent relapse and offset disorder recurrence may improve long-term outcome for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia.
Only 10.7% of survivors classified as unexpected by TRISS were corroborated as unexpected by a blinded, peer-review process. TRISS needs to be updated for meaningful interpretation; modifications need to be made and coefficients need to be revised.
Laparoscopy can be successfully performed in patients with a pathologic diagnosis of XGP. Although a longer operative time is required because of perinephric adhesions, the postoperative recovery is faster and cosmesis superior compared with the open approach. Modifications in the standard laparoscopic technique can be made to complete the procedure successfully and safely.
If there is to be an expansion of birth centres, service providers need to make sure that women's views are central to the design. Women will not cease having homebirths due to expanded birth centre options.
Elite female soccer athletes are susceptible to stress fractures and menstrual dysfunction and have delayed onset of menarche despite normal BMI and appropriate body perception and attitudes towards eating. Further studies are needed to better understand stress fracture risk in female soccer athletes and in other team sports to determine how these findings relate to long-term bone health in this population.
Although developed for RA, the RA-WIS is psychometrically sound for OA and demonstrates interval-level property.
Single ventral instrumentation can provide sufficient stability following corpectomy in the lumbar spine under the condition of a high BMD. Determination of BMD and the use of this guideline provides a valid tool for surgical planning.
As reported in previous publications, 1,5-AG reflects ambient glycaemic control and increases with reductions in HbA(1c) and postprandial glucose. The greater reductions in postprandial excursion achieved with BiAsp 30 compared with glargine were associated with greater increases in 1,5-AG. Even moderate elevations in HbA(1c) substantially lower 1,5-AG, suggesting that it can be most discriminating in identifying patients with excessive postprandial glucose excursions at HbA(1c) levels that approach the upper end of the normal range.
Specificity tended to be higher than sensitivity, in other words cytology tended to be more efficient in identifying women without sexually transmitted infection than in identifying those with infection. In summary, the Pap smear should not be used in lieu of more effective diagnostic test for sexually transmitted disease, and treatment should not be based on cytologic findings alone.
Instillation of intravesical chemotherapy immediately after TURB has not been embraced in the US. Adopting this policy would significantly lower the cost of BC care.
Lack of microscope calibration appears to be the leading cause of variance in ECD estimates in French eye banks. Other factors such as differences in counting strategy, the evaluation of smaller numbers of cells, and the different extent of experience of the technicians may also contribute to intraobserver and interobserver variability. Further comparative studies, including cross checking and the outcome of repeated counts from manual methods, are clearly needed with cross calibration to a computer based image archiving and analysis system.
Graduates of Canadian GIM training programs over the last ten years have identified perceived gaps between training and important areas for practice. They have identified competencies that should be emphasized in Canadian GIM programs. Ongoing review of graduate's perceptions of training programs as it applies to their current practice is important to ensure ongoing appropriateness of training programs. This information will be used to strengthen GIM training programs in Canada.
Our findings suggest that cystoscopic assessment and prophylactic treatment of an abnormal appearing, non-refluxing contralateral UO with Dx/HA is of little clinical benefit and should be abandoned.
Angiography allowed a more accurate evaluation of the degree of stenosis compared with colour-Doppler ultrasound. Moreover, it allowed diagnosis of important associated conditions that may affect therapeutic planning. In our series, we recorded no important complications related to angiography. Therefore, angiography remains the standard of reference in the preoperative evaluation of patients with clinically diagnosed cerebral ischaemia. Though fairly reliable as a first-line investigation, Colour-Doppler US is not sufficiently exhaustive as a pre-operative evaluation tool.
Emotional and behavioural problems as reported by the parents at the time their children were referred to the mental health service do not increase.
Forty-six percent of patients undergoing HA reported symptoms of nerve dysfunction within the first 6 weeks after surgery. One year postoperatively, these symptoms remained in only 18% of all patients. Traction time during surgery was not different in patients with and those without symptoms of nerve dysfunction.
This retrospective study showed that the sonographic sign of grit in the gallbladder is associated with a high relative risk for persistent abdominal symptoms after cholecystectomy. These findings will be re-evaluated in a prospective study to estimate the definitive clinical importance.
Elimination of onchocerciasis from most endemic foci in Africa appears to be possible. However, the requirements in terms of duration, coverage, and frequency of treatment may be prohibitive in highly endemic areas.
After OS, more triplets are found and the outcome of MP is worse. MP is known to be associated with morbidity, mortality, and economic and social risks. To counteract these complications (1.) better training for physicians performing OS should be encouraged and (2.) the Swiss law on reproductive medicine needs to be changed, with the introduction of eSET policies. This would lead to a dramatic decrease in neonatal and maternal morbidity/mortality as well as significant cost reductions for the Swiss healthcare system.
Adherence to LTVV in a general cohort of ICU patients was low, but it was better in patients with more severe lung disease. Overestimation of PBW may have contributed to our findings. Regular auditing of LTVV adherence might be considered a clinical indicator of good MV practice.
Findings suggest the campaign was well executed given the high percentage of participants recall and the increase in the recognition of stroke symptoms. However, the influence of the campaign in changing behaviour was not as evident. Further research is needed to examine factors that influence behaviour when a stroke strikes.
Lowering the blood alcohol concentration limit in Brazil had a greater impact on traffic fatalities than injuries, with a higher effect in the capital, where presumably the police enforcement was enhanced.
Reconstruction nailing of femoral shaft fractures can be a cost-effective method to reduce the risks and morbidity of missed femoral neck fractures if the incremental implant costs are<$650. Routine reconstruction nailing is cost effective if the rate of associated femoral neck fracture is>7% or the rate of missed femoral neck fracture is>38%. CT scans are not a cost-effective strategy to reduce the risk and morbidity of missed femoral neck fractures if the cost is>$243. Weaknesses of this study include the reliance on low-powered studies and on estimations of some utilities and costs. To prevent the morbidity of missed or occult femoral neck fractures, the use of reconstruction nails for femoral shaft fractures is cost effective when the incremental costs of implants are<$650.
Achieving an intraoperative watertight anastomosis is a very good predictor of a watertight cystogram on day 7. It seems feasible to avoid routine cystograms prior to TOV in the absence of other postoperative complications.
Catheter intervention performed at the same time as the diagnostic cardiac catheterization procedure is as successful and as safe as that performed at a later date. Hospital stay and costs, as well as procedural expenses are significantly reduced by this practice.
In heart and heart-lung-transplanted children and adolescents, due to reduced overall HRV short-term testing may give as reliable data as 24-h ECG. Therefore, especially when power spectral analysis has to be performed as a longitudinal assessment of re-innervation of the cardiac graft, short-term testing may offer an easily applicable and non-invasive diagnostic tool. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether HRV testing may contribute to rule out acute graft rejection.
The suicide rate is increasing in Poland, which calls for a national prevention initiative. Hangings are the predominant suicide method based on official registration. However, suicide among females appears grossly underestimated given their lower estimated sensitivity of suicide certification, greater use of "soft" suicide methods, and the very high 7:1 male-to-female rate ratio. Changes in the ICD classification system resulted in a temporary suicide data blackout in 1980-1982, and significant modifications of the death categories of senility and unknown causes, after 1997, suggest the need for data quality surveillance.
Since most lung mass are carcinomatous in origin, depending on various factors (age, sex, smoking habit and size), the recommendation of FNA as the first line investigation are warranted because of high yield to risk for complication ratio, but in mediastinal mass in which many etiologic cells of origin cannot be diagnosed accurately by retrieved cytological cell, the CNB for small histology section is recommended as an initial investigation method without the loss of time required for cytological aspiration.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with low mechanical index using Sonovue is a feasible tool in evaluating the response of hepatocellular carcinoma to radiofrequency ablation. Accuracy is comparable to 4-row spiral CT.
Effects from the diabetic microenvironment appear sustainable in cell culture: pericytes derived from diabetic donor eyes seemingly possess a "metabolic memory" in vitro, which may be linked to original donor health status. Diabetes- and pericyte-dependent effects on EC growth and angiogenesis may reflect alterations in bioactive lipid, angiocrine, and chemomechanical signaling. Altogether, our results suggest that diabetes alters pericyte contractile phenotype and cytoskeletal signaling, which ultimately may serve as a key, initiating event required for retinal endothelial reproliferation, angiogenic activation, and the pathological neovascularization accompanying proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
More efforts could be made to improve the care of dying children and their families. The Paediatric Palliative Service could assist in advance care planning at the end of life.
(18)F-FDG PET/CT was sensitive and accurate for the detection and staging of local and metastatic recurrent colorectal carcinoma, with higher specificity in the detection of local recurrences. The (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan induced treatment changes in 30/75 patients, including 12/32 patients in which surgical treatment was previously planned, and progression free survival time was significantly longer in these patients.
The contribution of obstetric complications to the current level of neurological impairment in well discordant co-twins suggests that the spectrum of neuroabnormality, ranging from neurological signs to schizophrenia, in monozygotic discordant twins may be the result of subtle gene-environment interaction.
The results do not support the hypothesis that geomagnetic activity is related to occurrence of sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients.
The optimal HbA(1c) value for the diagnosis of diabetes is 7.0% but even at this HbA(1c) the PPV is suboptimal and may cause up to 12% of patients without diabetes, as defined by a normal OGTT, to be classified having diabetes mellitus.
Adenosine testing reliably identified patients with definitive bradycardia-pacing indications in whom alternative diagnoses were excluded. Further work is needed to evaluate the role of this test in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope.
There is a notable difference between all three populations in terms of TWI. Furthermore, within the same population, values of adequacy of TWI changed signifi cantly when they were assessed using different criteria. More scientifi c evidence is required for the production of better defined water intake recommendations in the future as well as more studies focusing on beverage consumption patterns in different settings.
Iron supplementation based on iron status early in pregnancy, with 60 mg ferrous iron or 27 mg iron containing heme, resulted in adequate iron stores at 6 weeks postpartum among 75% or 70% of the women, respectively. However, 6 weeks were not sufficient to rebuild iron stores in women with large peripartum blood loss.
Neither HASTE nor TrueFISP alone are sufficient for the detection and characterization of hepatic lesions.
Delirium is still frequently undiagnosed and misdiagnosed in older people presenting to emergency departments. This indicates a need for further education and professional development for and by health-care practitioners. Only with greater awareness of delirium will the care and health outcomes of older adults presenting with delirium in acute care settings improve.
In high-risk patients with vertebralorigin disease, stenting demonstrated a low procedural complication rate, a moderate restenosis rate, good long-term patency and good longterm stroke-free survival. Placement of drug-eluting stents appears to reduce in-stent restenosis.
r-hu EPO treatment has effect on changes in Hb, Ht, Ret and reduces the number of inevitable blood transfusions for anaemia of prematurity.
Although the SSC has been integrated into perioperative practice in Calgary, participants believe that previous informal checkpoints were able to circumvent most perioperative issues. Although the SSC may help with flow and equipment, participants believe it fails to show a subjective, clinically important improvement.
The risk of GB malignancy resulting from incidentally detected polyps is extremely low. Incidentally detected GB polyps measuring 6 mm or less may require no additional follow-up. Data are inconclusive regarding polyps 7 mm or greater, and further studies are warranted.
The supply of sweetened canned fruit to households may be an added risk to dental health for the children in that household.
Our findings encourage the introduction of immunohistochemistry as a rapid screening tool for the assessment of BRAF status in melanoma patients in routine diagnostic procedures and prepare the ground for other studies to highlight the role of immunohistochemical BRAF V600E expression in patients at the time of progression.
Poor adherence to warfarin is common. A screening tool based on nine demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors, if further validated in other patient populations, may help to identify groups of patients at lower risk for nonadherence so that intensified efforts at increased monitoring and intervention can be focused on higher-risk patients.
The findings suggest that co-viewing and discussing television programmes are more common in families where television exposure is high. Because both co-viewing and discussing television programmes were associated with higher fear scores regardless of the quantity and quality of television exposure, the research shows that in everyday life co-viewing may not be done in such a way that it leads to a reduction of children's fears. More studies are needed to explore the co-viewing practices of families in more detail.
Differences in commercial data in the location and numeration of food and alcohol establishments are associated with neighborhood racial and socioeconomic characteristics and may introduce biases concerning neighborhood food and alcohol environments, racial and socioeconomic disparities, and health.
The prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with reflux esophagitis was 74.5%, and no difference was observed when comparing with infection rate in patients with normal endoscopy (76.4%). Therefore, a non-significant association was found between this esophageal disorder and H. pylori infection.
Young children with severe liver dysfunction appear to have a high prevalence of food sensitisation. Hepatic mechanisms may therefore be important for establishing immune tolerance to dietary antigens in humans.
Significantly less pain, lower analgesia requirement, and shorter hospital stay with early return to normal activities were observed in the tubeless PCNL group v the primary nephrostomy tube PCNL group. Tubeless PCNL in selected patients is a secure, effective, and less morbid procedure that does not compromise patient safety and concerns. We recommend that tubeless PCNL be the preferred procedure in selected patients for management of nephrolithiasis.
In women with large myomas, the presence of multiple tumors is independently associated with heavier blood loss at delivery but not with postpartum hemorrhage of>or = 1000 mL.
Skull base chordomas characterized by isochromosome 1q and monosomy 13 provide support for the concept of the loss of putative tumor suppressor loci on 1p and 13q and aggressive tumor behavior.
This finding contrasts with studies of other injuries, suggesting that occupation does not fully account for variations in eye injury risk. Because protective eye-wear can prevent most serious eye injuries, we hypothesize that differences in protective eye-wear use between men and women may contribute to differences in eye injury rates, although follow-up studies are needed to confirm this. Prevention efforts should consider targeting high-risk demographic groups in addition to high-risk occupations.
High levels of alcohol outlets in the community enable youth access to alcohol through commercial outlets, family, and social networks.
Cued MI augments corticomotor excitability associated with healthy and paretic muscles related to the imagined task. Age should be considered when selecting a cueing strategy for maximum effectiveness.
These findings suggest that chlorhexidine mouthwash used twice daily may reduce the severity of CsA-induced gingival overgrowth. Further research is warranted to determine the optimal dose and treatment regimen.
Some NIADs, and in particular metformin, were frequently used in patients at high risk of complications when they were contraindicated. There is a need to increase awareness of potential inappropriate prescribing and to monitor the quality of prescribing patterns in order to help physicians and policymakers to yield better clinical outcomes in T2DM.
The authors showed that radical cystectomy is a relatively safe procedure for elderly patients. The elderly patient who is thought to be unsuitable for surgery not only is deprived of his right to definite curative therapy but also is exposed to higher morbidity and mortality and worse quality of life than are those who undergo operations. The authors conclude that it is unjustified to avoid radical cystectomy in the elderly population on the basis of age alone.
The QOF patient experience indicators do not reward practices that offer good patient access. A standard patient survey with financial incentive may be more effective in identifying and rewarding practices that offer better access, including opportunity to book appointments with a particular doctor.
Atherosclerotic CVD is a risk factor for having glaucomatous optic disk appearance. Symptomatic atherosclerosis involving the brain vasculature may also affect the eye and lead to NTG. Patients with ischemic strokes due to large artery atherosclerosis or small artery occlusion must be examined and followed for NTG.
GDM and milder degrees of glucose intolerance in twin pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of asymmetric overgrowth in a manner that is related to the degree of glucose intolerance.
Chemotherapy-experienced women with ovarian cancer have consistent preferences for the best and worst health states associated with the side effects of chemotherapy. Patients are more averse to nausea and vomiting than many other symptoms. Women's perceptions of pancytopenia may be dependent upon the number of prior cycles of chemotherapy and site of care for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia.
Graft patency rates were superior in the trial compared with nontrial patients. Symptom-directed graft failure rates were approximately double those of trial patients.
This study suggests that the evaluation of both Clinical Governance and organizational appropriateness through standardized and repeatable tools, such as OPTIGOV(©) and AEP, is a key strategy for healthcare quality. The relationship between the two underlines the central role of Clinical Governance, and especially of EBM and Clinical Audit, in determining a rational improvement of appropriateness levels.
Compared with ABPM, use of the higher of the left and right arm readings measured sequentially appears to overestimate true mean blood pressure. As there is no significant difference in the extent of disparity with ABPM by left or right arm, this is unlikely to be due to arm dominance and may be due to the 'white-coat' effect reducing blood pressure on repeated measurement. Where a large inter-arm blood pressure difference is detected with sequential measurement, healthcare professionals should re-measure the blood pressure in the original arm.
Our results are compatible with the genetic incompatibility hypothesis. They suggest that the female wasps recognize sibs on the basis of a chemical signature carried or emitted by males possibly using a "self-referent phenotype matching" mechanism.
Our results suggest that the δT values as signs of impaired Tsk regulation are dynamic and better detectable in cold skin. The results underline the need of caution in interpretation of IRT findings.
In a large international AHF trial, time to treatment with study medication varied markedly across regions. Earlier administration of study medication was associated with modestly better dyspnoea relief, but not 30-day clinical outcomes. The association between timing of treatment with study medication and study endpoints may have implications for the interpretation of AHF studies and future trial design.
Information regarding the incidence of PONV after oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures remains scanty. We conclude that there does not appear to be a rationale for the prophylactic administration of antiemetic drugs in such surgical procedures. A watch-and-wait policy and simple GL may provide significant relief. Antiemetic medications are to be considered only in case of non-responders and intractable PONV.
The shading sign is not exclusive of endometriomas or endometrioid tumors. Homogenous shading was the most prevalent pattern in endometriomas and half of the cases with focal/multifocal shading within a complex mass were endometrioid carcinomas.
Cell activation and thrombin generation were significantly reduced as a result of the presence of immobilized heparin in a system of cardiopulmonary bypass with reduced plasma heparin. However, evidence of contact activation in the bonded circuits was found after 120 minutes, indicating that anticoagulation in the system was not adequate. This becomes more important clinically where the extrinsic pathway of coagulation is also involved.
